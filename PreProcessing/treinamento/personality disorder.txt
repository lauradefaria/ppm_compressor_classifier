please help me understand what i went through this is going to be lengthy and ahead of time i want to apologize to anyone this might be sensitive to. it involves an affair and i'm struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that i might die of a broken heart over this. i'll begin with the story fully and what i need from all of you is help to see similarities in me that'd make me a bpd sufferer or her or what. i am so mentally screwed up over this that it's been hard to move on. i'm almost 3 months no contact as of right now. the story begins at work. i worked at a rehab facility in a health field. she was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that i'd caught her eye and she'd hoped to talk to me from the very first time she'd seen me. as i began to see her at work she started casually flirting. once she needed equipment that'd take blood pressure and i said i only had my pox that does hr and spo2, she replied i want everything with a look. as we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring. i thought she was beautiful and she was very observant. later, she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times we'd spoken. it progressed to innocent things like once i'd said me and a coworker missed her while she'd been off for a week or so. she came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said you missed me? when helping a patient up from bed she'd placed her hand firmly over mine as i held onto his walker. little flirty things like this intrigued me. i know that i should not have proceeded but i could tell that she was unhappy and i did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness. she was from moldova and her husband was russian. they'd been married for i believe 10 years and had a son who was 5 years old. i began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun. although she'd been in the us for 5 years she'd never been to a movie once in that time. i was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life. finally, one day we exchanged instagram information and soon began talking on there. she wasn't quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently. as we began talking it progressed relatively quickly, after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work. it was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me she'd planned to leave her husband and just be alone. i tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place. when discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldn't be doing anything and all of that. i told her the tv was in my room and all i had in there was my bed. she was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that. well, within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out. for the entire time she was over we made out. she even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed. i know she would have gone all the way if i'd tried. this is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little. she told me she broke up with one guy because he didn't kiss good and stuff like that. she told me eventually that people when she worked at amazon offered a threesome with her. i have no idea how that conversation even began. she began to sound almost manic with the things she'd say as if i'd freed some mind that was eager to be free. she told me once that she wasn't ready to date older men because she wasn't ready for that. when we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because i joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles. she told me there were times she thought she loved her husband. it was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship kids, home, money . she even told me he had cameras inside the house that he'd watch and monitor. as i started to become more attached to her i became more nervous and more fearful. it was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of she'd let anyone go before letting me go meaning friends etc. the situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and i'd have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness. she truly was to me someone very special. one of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be less happy than i appeared at work. she just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on i feared that maybe i couldn't trust her. she revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt. like, i know she had a tumultuous upbringing. she literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath. i know her dad whipped her and her brother. she was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid. she also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school. she told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work. she didn't like me complimenting her too much. she would try to change the subject if i'd say much to that effect. she didn't like when i gave her positive reinforcement either. like, if i said i appreciated something she'd say i was trying to train her. one thing i'd said i appreciate was when she sent photos of home. like, what she was doing or what her son and her were doing. i just liked feeling as if i was included in her life. i spoiled the hell out of her. i brought her food and everything i could each time we worked together about once a week . what happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss. i did not perform well. the anxiety of it all and the feeling that i was being told when and if things are going to happen. this wasn't like i'm feeling horny and you are right next to me. this was i'm coming over this day and we're going to get it on. i'm 33 and my sex drive isn't quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well, it didn't go well. this was the first time she said i love you though when we were doing other things in bed together. i became nervous about my failure to perform. i didn't discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake. the next time we saw each other and i said i love you, she said can we not say i love you so much. that shook me because i didn't know what it meant, like holidays? lol i told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt. fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and i saw her getting close to another coworker at work. this coworker later said he felt some vibes from her too but once he saw we'd become close he didn't think any more of it. when i saw them two close, i asked her about it. she said you doubt my feelings for you? she got upset and rightfully so, later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it. now our birthdays are approaching. i'd thought we'd see each other on my birthday. no we didn't. then her birthday was the day after mine. didn't see each other that day either. then another 5 days or so went by and she didn't come over or anything. just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for wicked game. paranoia took over me and i just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself. she told me that no she wasn't distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share. then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that i felt better. two days later and she called to break up with me and said love is not enough. that was the blackest my life has ever seemed. i had never experienced anything like it. like i was just floating through a sea of nothingness. the very next day she texted to say she still thought of me and that she was worried. i just told her that i couldn't help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time. almost a week went by and she called me. i didn't answer because i figured if it were important she would have called again. curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and i called her back. she answered and we spoke, she said that she had to become better at disappointing me. she told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didn't take long. she revealed that she'd written in the birthday card she got me but never gave me that i made her want to have kids again. she later revealed that she feared and projected that i'd be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me. the fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that we'd rest when we were old. she is a very hard worker. i've never met anyone so goal oriented in my life. she was truly busy and between her husband not helping her, her son, school and work, she was truly doing it all. i can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as i became closer i could no longer act cool. after we got back together she suggested we go to the movies. i was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together. some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me. i had a great time and i thought she did too. she said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that she'd never forgive herself for what she'd done when she broke up with me. she told me when she'd broken up she stowed away everything i'd given her and deleted our conversation on instagram. she also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session. this was i think one of two times she'd ever say she was sorry to me. i don't remember when it was that she'd said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said i need to love you less. that's not a good thing to hear. this period was probably the best time of our relationship. she even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment. it was moments like these that i needed where i actually felt valuable to her. i didn't think much of myself outside of opportunities like this. a week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place. when she came over this time i performed better but still not well enough. i think i went like 5 minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason. i'm not a very experienced guy and i never really talked about it with her because i thought she'd think less of me. a few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work. we'd have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course i assumed incorrectly it was because of me. i needed reassurance probably a little too often. i don't know if it was the nature of the relationship, the first breakup, or what it was but i felt on edge. she assured me it wasn't because of me that she didn't want to or couldn't stay after work. she said her husband found a innocent picture that i'd given her of me. i knew that a lot of what i'd given her was stowed away so i wondered how only this picture was found. he then deduced that i was a person on her instagram from my photo. she warned me to not text her and that she'd contact me. this went on for a little while successfully until one morning i sent her a couple of messages on instagram. he was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where i'd said i love you. she didn't contact me the rest of the day so i knew something was wrong. that night i called her and she answered crying. she said that he'd told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things. he also messaged me the next day saying i hear you are very good friends with my wife, i also want to be friends. i told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him. a few hours later, he had blocked me. she told me he'd even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her. it was truly messed up. this whole situation is, i know. when he blocked me, i wondered why. she told me he was viewing the messages over and over. she told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family. i never heard much about it after that. my paranoia increased. a few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasn't coming over to spend the night at all. i felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but i wasn't sure. after her husband found out though understandably there wasn't as much communication between her and i. now i waited for her to initiate everything. i waited for phone calls. i waited for texts. one day she texted me precisely before i began work and i said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do. she told me i was trying to train her. we never had real quality time together. work was really the best thing we had between the two of us. this is where it all began to break. one day i exchanged just a couple texts with her even though it was against the rules and i never received a call. i had a spell of emotions come over me and i got upset i said some rough things, nothing too crazy. the next day we spoke and i said asked her if she was happy. she said if she still calls and i still answer that we're happy. she then began dissecting what i was really asking and she came to the conclusion that i was actually saying that i wasn't happy. i felt our communication was so difficult and we hadn't spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together. she told me she doesn't do reassurance. she said she'd have to take time to herself and she'd miss me and stuff but she'd not really be speaking to me. the next week or more i just got texts saying things like i miss you , can't talk , good morning. this went on and on for like i said, over a week. i was getting really affected by it. there i was the other man in this whole thing and i'm wondering how important am i? after all, she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship. she was absolutely my primary partner. i finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said don't contact me i don't know what is going on, i don't have clarity on anything etc. she must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning i received another good morning message. so i sent another similar message again. this one was delivered because she didn't say anything at all. i'll admit, i wanted her to fight for our relationship. i wanted her to see how difficult this was for me. i understand that i was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent. i was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life. well, after nothing came to me within a couple of days i freaked out. i went back on everything i'd said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls. like a whole bunch. i was so fearful and felt like i was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that i'd been responsible for. i still felt i was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but i knew that i was screwing up. after all of this she said it was toxic and that i was frightening her. after she said that i lost it. i was supposed to work with her that night and i called off because i couldn't fathom being near her when she'd said i frightened her. well, that night she was super pissed. she said that i was acting like an 18 year old boy not a 33 year old man. she said there was no more us at work, no more spending time together, no more talking , no more anything. i was shook up by this as i'd been by everything before it. i told her honestly that when i'd called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and i. i had known my manager for years and she was a friend, so i didn't think much of it. after she said all of this there is no more us stuff several more days went by and i decided to resign from the job. she talked to me finally a couple days after the day i resigned. when we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because i didn't understand her. at the end of the call i revealed to her that i quit the job. she abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after i told her i'd done it because of what she said. she later texted me and said she wanted me to let her go. this where things got really messy. she told me she wanted to be single. i told her i need time to move on. she replied, i will not remind you of myself. i told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this. she replied, i will not send a letter, i don't like writing letters. a few days again went by and i tried reaching out to her. she asked me what i'd done in those few days apart. i told her that i'd done nothing, meaning i hadn't been with anyone else. when we began talking again things got rough, she began trying to lose weight. she asked if it was because i was nervous why i hadn't performed well in bed. i told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body. she talked about getting breast implants. she told me that the beginning was fantasy and that it'd never be like that again. she once texted me and said that she missed me more than i even knew but that she can't be vulnerable. she said that she needed to learn to love not me. she said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today. i know women can be emotional and i was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level. after a struggle to see her, she finally said she wanted to see me. when i did i felt just as we always had together. the butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl i'd ever laid my eyes on. she allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time she'd allow me to do so. what happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager. she didn't forward it so that she could protect my employment in case i changed my mind. when we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us. one night she was upset because something regarding her parents' immigration wasn't going well. she did not tell me what it was initially. i always wanted to know what was bothering her and i was sensitive to her moods. my life with her felt so microscopic. each interaction was magnified. each gesture became what i'd live with for the next week as we spent time apart. i was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on. she was very good at reading my expressions. she stormed off and when i caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with. i thought something of this because she'd said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship. later that night i said i wanted her to be happy. that i wanted to have a good time. she asked what i meant by a good time. i said that i wanted to have fun. that we never had any opportunities to just have fun together. it was soon after that i decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf i guess . when i did so she took one of the classes with me. so we'd have monday nights together in class. our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced. this left us only with our class together. she would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work. i did my best each week to spoil her. i made salmon salad that i kept on ice in the car and we'd eat it after class released. i got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax. i really missed her. i really really really missed her. i needed time with her to really bond. her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me. i became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged i'd done that i began to spiral. in the class we had a good time initially. there was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together. it was great. i felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her. she asked me during that time jokingly if i had brought the salmon salad again for her. also, i'd gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called bounty. she asked where they were and why i'd not given them to her. she told me she liked seeing my reaction when i was asked things like this. when i told her i hadn't eaten them because i'd had enough sweets. she asked who have you been getting sweets with. i just said a friend of mine will . i felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together. texts were more sporadic and often mine that i sent weren't replied to. we still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about. i craved shared experiences and a sense of security. i'd done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged. one day i called her after i got out of a therapy session and asked her how do i ask for what i need? i was being starved. i felt overwhelmed by how much i felt i was being ignored. however, i do know during this time she wasn't caring for herself much either. she was irritated when i asked this of her. one night near the very end i offered her a betterhelp therapy membership. i told her it was the best thing that i could give her. i had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things i'd tried to do. she said she didn't want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go. she told me she didn't like how i was trying to change her. another week near the end, i sat next to her in class like always. after class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table. i certainly felt the push pull behavior. i know she had a lot on her plate but i was single, i didn't have all of these responsibilities and dramas. i was focused on her. a little too much maybe. i didn't know if she'd done this before?? why the cameras in the house?? why the invitation of a threesome?? i didn't know if i was really important. my mind raced and raced. one of the final days we had i asked her in a text if i ask to spend more time with her, isn't that something she'd want to do because she loves me. the next day we spoke on the phone and i asked her to reply to that when she could, she said that i can't ask someone to do that. she'd reply when if she was ready to do so. i was struggling so much, i have thought at times i might die of a broken heart over this. what finally happened was her son was sick, she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that i don't text her. i agreed and the next day we saw each other in class. i broke. i asked her if she'd have any time for us after class, she just shook her head no. i snapped. i began just staring at her, intermittently for a good ten minutes or so. sulking in the chair next to her, i was probably a real sorry sight to see. she looked to me and said we'll talk after class. i made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad. when we got out of class i was immediately upset. she patronizingly said let's have a discussion. as if i hadn't been trying to have one all along about my needs. i said did you talk to your husband today? she said, i have to, he has my son. i replied well nothing for me then, huh? the let's have a discussion remark made me begin to crack a smile she did not like that because i just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this. i love her, i still do. how on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start. the argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away. i followed and she said i don't like the way you love. your love is overwhelming. she got in the car and as i tried to offer her a water i had brought for her, she said i don't want anything from you anymore. she had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home, that's why i had brought the water for her. she went home and i went to meet up with my one friend. i called her and left a voicemail that said something like i wish you the best in all the things you have going on. i hope you learn to love and accept love. the next day i hadn't yet heard from her and i texted her. when i did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs. she can't handle arguments in love. she told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husband's proposal to get back together. by that she meant they had sex. she told me that what we had wasn't special, that it was in my head. one thing she asked was why i smiled. i said, i couldn't believe i was being treated like this. she replied, you're saying i'm a bad partner. i said, i've been asking you for weeks to see you. i just couldn't believe the whole thing. she acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband. her mind truly was chaotic. where was she when i was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together. we have not communicated at all since that night. the last thing i sent was one heart emoji. i had no words from her to say anything about what i meant. nothing. i have cried so much over the last few months. i think often about the day that i die and if i might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if we'd had a chance. a real chance. i don't know. i blame myself. i know that i might have a problem. maybe we both have a problem. i don't know anything anymore. it was real to me. maybe i was just being used? if i could go back i would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did. i felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced. i don't know what does this mean to you guys on here? i've read a lot of bpd, narc stuff. youtube, reddit, you name it. do i have a problem? is how i acted, aside from beginning this affair in the first place, that outlandish? why didn't she understand how i might feel being in my position? was this just a natural breakdown of an affair? did i really mean nothing? how do i move on from this? how was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has. is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally? is it because she sabotages relationships. i can't see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed, there doesn't seem to be any consistency. i am so confused. thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing. thanks for any hesitance to pass judgement onto me.
the hollow self my life is spent largely devoted to work. between morning prep, commute, actual work hours, and evening prep like laundry, packing lunches, and other small maintenance tasks i only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. after all, i need to be in bed at a decent hour or else i won t be well rested for the next work day. that s it. that s my life. meanwhile, even though i m so devoted to work that i sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it, i m barely earning enough money to survive. i have over 50,000 in debt that is slowly growing as i struggle to make ends meet. i don t know if i can ever pay it off. i can pay off maybe 1 3rd of it if i really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. i m turning 40 in 6 months. at what point am i supposed to go from surviving to thriving ? i know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but i just don t see the light at the end of the tunnel. what is my purpose? why am i grinding on the world s worst ever rpg system? i feel like i m on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year, and at some point i know i won t be able to keep up. my job itself is relatively easy, i m a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. for the most part it s just pulling reports for managers and being really good at excel and power bi. though i don t know if i m that good at my job. tomorrow marks 1 year in this position, and every night i feel like i m doing the bare minimum. like i m that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. i imagine they say things like, he s so slow. what s he even doing all day? or i better schedule this meeting because if i wait for him to do it, it ll never get done. they don t say these things out loud of course, and maybe they don t even think them but maybe they do. maybe i m just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. i think i m ok because my head is still above water, but realistically if i keep doing this i will drown. i need to swim. i just feel like such a loser, all the time. i don t have kids, and i don t want them. i m not married, but i ve been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. we live together. she makes a lot more than i do, so she pays the mortgage and i pay everything else. it s probably not a fair arrangement for her, but i just literally don t make enough to split everything 50 50. she earns 40k more than i do a year. she would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. then we could split the 4th one, that would make it even. even with that justification in my mind, it makes me feel like a loser. not that she makes more than me good for her! she deserves it! just that i can t contribute equally. i feel like a mooch. we work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work. but her s pays more. them s the breaks i guess. overwhelming shame. about nearly everything. i m too fat. i m too bald. i m too old. i m not smart enough. i m not rich enough. i m not funny enough. i know those are called automatic negative thoughts , or ants, and like ants they should be easy to squash. i ve read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books. i would go to therapy, but it s expensive. my company pays for 3 sessions a year. the other 49 weeks you can fuck off and die, i guess. is there more to this life? is this all i m supposed to do? click buttons all fucking day, sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show, then repeat? all day, every day, until i m old enough to scrape by on social security? this is it, huh? this is the whole fucking thing? there needs to be more, because i swear sometimes it just doesn t feel worth it. i m not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going? i have hobbies and interests, and i indulge in them as often as i can. i grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces, i hike in the woods and enjoy nature, there s so many things to occupy my free time if i had any but the fact is i devote 87.5 of my day to making someone else richer. so my measly 3 hours a day which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking. i have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because i can t even be present to tend to my own garden. it s absolutely ridiculous. when exactly am i supposed to do anything of substance, of value? 3 hours in the fucking dark. that s what i get to live off of. most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt. 50,000 would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years. meanwhile, i get to help analyze the company private jet spend. cost us over 365,000 to operate for a total of 11 days last month. we paid 75,000 just in pilot fees for the month of january. i don t earn that in a year. so when i see how much money there is, how much is available to toss around, and just how little of it i get why would i work harder ? why would i sign up for more of this disrespect? i just don t know why. why can t i work 4 days instead of 5? why can t i be remote, considering i have only had 1 face to face meeting in the last month? i m wasting a ton of money on a car that i primarily use to get to work, a ton of money on a special wardrobe that i only wear at work it s absurd. and depressing.
i just need to vent about my partner. i think my partner has bpd maybe avpd hi everyone. i have no idea how to start this. i m honestly not even sure if bpd or avpd is correct i m just grasping at straws at this point. my 27f boyfriend 28m s brother has been diagnosed with bpd. which is why this is my first step. and while i m obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this, i m just lost. and need someone to listen. i am massively struggling in my relationship and i just need someone to listen. even if this goes nowhere. my boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if i were to ask the same in return. we just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and i can t quite think of an example of that at the moment he does ask for things in one moment and when i do them or stick to it, he tells me it s wrong. example, he has wanted to get a photo id for a while. we have two options, drivers licence or a photo card. about a month or probably two ago, he said he needed photo id for a test at work he d been putting off. then he said not long ago that we don t motivate each other to do the things we need to. i know he has anxiety planning things and doesn t want to so for our anniversary i said pick which id you want, i ll drive you there, pay for it, and it ll be done. i ll put all the planning into it. all good and he loved that idea. the day we were supposed to go, he was angry about something and it caused an argument. so we didn t go. which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. to today. each week he said i ll do it next week on my day off so i asked and he pushed it again. today we spoke about it and while he s not good at planning, i was waiting around to find out if we were going or not, as i wanted to plan when i was done work and went to get gas and groceries. when it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test, i told him that i didn t care if we went but if he wanted to study more, now was the time. he told me tonight that he only did it so id shut up about it and when i said you told me you wanted more motivation so i gave it to you he just said fair . but we always have those moments where he says he wants something and i change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. if i try and talk to him about my needs or what i m wanting more of or how i m hurt by something, he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. or he ll just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what i was even talking about. if we have an argument for 1 full hour let s say. there will be lulls in the argument. maybe every 15 minutes. maybe start, half hour mark, and then end. it always changes but the lull is when he sits, listens, and answers me with respect. the other times it s that i have said even one word to set him off and he s miserable. and angry and not nice. i m finding myself constantly working around his moods. sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a tiktok or something i find interesting. if he agrees with what i m showing him, all is good. if he doesn t, he gets angry. says he s confused and basically shuts down. tells me he thinks that s dumb or why would someone even do that. they re not part of my life. why do i even need to listen to that . if i m talking about my work or just complaining, he ll tell me why he doesn t want to hear it. that it s not part of his world so it doesn t matter. i ve asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever i do he ll tell me something he needs in return. he can t just take blame for things. sometimes he can. but normally can t. i definitely do not help the situation because i am at his every beck and call and he s at none of mine. if he asks to be left alone, and i walk to another room, he says he feels guilty that i m going away. and that he ll just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesn t get his way anyway. he wants to be left alone a lot. can t ever take anything i say and listen. always has to tell me why whatever i m going through is something he d love to have or how his life is worse. example we moved for his work. away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me. while she was being shitty all the time, she was the last person i had to talk to. and if i m sad about it, he tells me that s his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesn t understand why i m upset. if something small happens, he wildly blows it out of proportion. especially if it s something he doesn t understand. i have to be careful with how i joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something. if we go out at all, he doesn t want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious. i m just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and i m looking for advice or help or just something. thank you for reading this long novel. i really appreciate you all.

old friendships past due date? i'm pretty much completely alone. my family is mostly dead and the rest no contact. i'm f 42 divorced, no kids, and i just ended a three year post marriage relationship that was pretty toxic. i have two best friends since high school. we've known each other over 25 years and we used to be inseparable. we all had family issues so we became our own family. they both moved out of state at least 15 years ago so the majority of our friendship is on the phone and we maybe visit each other once or twice a year. my last relationship which lasted three years, really got in the way of our friendships. my boyfriend was so clingy i could never call my friends because he wouldn't leave me alone for a minute. that's a whole other unhealthy issue i can't get into. lol . but as an avoidant person it drove me crazy. anytime i had the chance to be alone without my boyfriend the last thing i wanted to do was call my friends. i needed alone time. i did try to break up with him several times. he even moved out a few times but kept coming back. i finally broke up with him for good about six months ago. anyway, i understand why they are reluctant to just go back to the way things were in our friendship. i don't blame them for being upset with me and i fully plan to try my best to make it up to them and i'm grateful that they are willing to talk to me at all but... i'm not sure i like them anymore. we've been friends for so long. i seriously don't have anyone else in my life and i am afraid i am just doing the avoidant thing and looking for reasons to write them out of my life. i've done that with everyone else in my life but these two always seemed special and i feel like we've known each other so long they are family and i want to always know them but they aren't really being good friends anymore. i know people grow apart and i admit that i am the one who stopped talking as much initially and like i said i was and am more than prepared to make up to them the fact that i haven't been around but honestly i wasn't around because i was in a toxic relationship and i told them that every time i did get a chance to talk to them. i talked about how i was stuck for financial reasons and covid and that i was losing my mind to never be alone and they didn't help me. they didn't encourage me to get out or give me advice they just got more and more distant and now that i am broken up they tell me this guy was bad for me but they wouldn't tell me that when we were together and that's what i needed to hear from them. instead they just acted like they liked my bf and talked bad about both of us to each other. i hate to say but it almost feels like they were enjoying me being in a bad relationship. maybe i'm just paranoid. they say they forgive me but they don't talk to me very much. one really doesn't call me or answer me and the other calls all the time but i'm not allowed to talk about my relationship at all. he has hung up on me twice for even mentioning it. i get that he doesn't like my ex but neither do i and i was in a toxic relationship for three years, i need to talk some of it through. i would never do that to them and god knows i have had to listen to some boring and or stupid problems of theirs repeatedly over the years. why can't they do that for me? i know people out grow each other. they have made new friends and i need to as well but it's hard for me because well, i have avpd. ideally, i would like to keep them as friends and make new friends that understand more about the person i am now instead of the person i was in high school. but the part of me that pushes people away wants to push them out and i don't know what to do? do they get to treat me bad because i wasn't as accessible to them for a while? i was never completely gone i just couldn't be there as much. do they get points for being friends with me so long? should i just over look it? or am i right that they are being disrespectful by telling me what i can or can't talk about, hanging up on me if i mention something they don't like, talking to each other and excluding me even if they are talking about coming into town and staying with me even when they are not invited? i have to work and they are on vacation but please come stay at my house and expect me to drop everything to do what you want? we never do what i want when they come to visit because i live here so i have to be on board to do everything they want to do. i know it's a long story. there is a lot more to it too but am i blowing things out of proportion and prematurely ending my longest and only friendships ? or has the time apart from them given me clarity to see who they really are which is bossy and disrespectful of me and i should just try and make new friends that don't judge me so harshly, like talking and listening to me, and actually live in my town? tldr i have had a hard life and i want to stand up for myself. but it's leaving me completely alone. am i cutting out my friends too quickly?
i wanted to be different. so, when i was younger, i knew perfectly well that my family had issues, the only thing was that i thought that it was normal. i looked at my parent's divorce, how poor my parents both were, my mother's constant struggles with drugs, mental health, jobs, and relationships and figured that there were more kids at school who's parents also divorced, so what makes mine any different? i kept going through life, made basically no friends, and in the fifth grade i moved parents. i switched from living with my mother to living with my father. it was strange as both parents had very different parenting styles. my mother was more uninvolved due to her relationships, mental health, and other issues. on the other hand, my father is very authoritarian and often wasn't home as he spent his entire day at his office. i don't want to keep going on about the messes that happened in my life because i feel like i'm just complaining at this point. i just wish my family cared more. it's strange to think that after all the signs i showed, my family did nothing. they didn't stop and think something was wrong because they were so focused on everything else. and after everything i did to try and help my family members too, it's like they never considered that i was hurting too. when my brother's depression led him to be hospitalized, why would nobody think that hurt me? or when my dad lost his grandfather and he couldn't hold himself together? i comforted him while my brother though given his condition i don't blame him remained distant. there's plenty more, too much that i did that someone else should have done. children shouldn't have to be adults because their parents are too busy or naive to do it themselves. i know i'm not giving much detail given some of the things i've mentioned, so, i'm sorry for that, i'm just not ready to share those things yet. i want nothing more than to leave my relatives behind and never look back, because all i can remember is how they failed me, and how i actually believed that they were good people until someone finally got close enough to me to see how bad my life was. i still can't believe someone had to tell me these weren't normal and that i did have bad parents. i grew up not knowing that these bad things were actually bad. i thought it was normal, and maybe to some degree they are normal, but definitely not all of it. because i thought how i felt was normal and because when i did try to speak up i was invalidated by those relatives who had also gone through something. just because i could hide my pain better than them didn't mean they were hurting worse than i was, but it sure made them feel that way. i wanted so badly to be different than everyone else because of this. i saw people who were hurting, who thought that i was normal, so i didn't want to end up like them. if what i was was normal, then i promised myself i would watch the mistakes my relatives made and not copy them. i would be someone different, someone people would like because i had it all together under control . but i didn't, i was just hiding. i wanted so badly to be someone special, because maybe then i would feel wanted or accepted. and now because of that, it hurts me deeply when people say my condition is normal. i just can't bring myself to believe that this is normal, that everyone feels like this. it makes me feel so weak and pathetic. that's why i hid, because if i did try to show people that i was hurting, then they would just brush me off and invalidate me again. i wanted to be special, and now to some degree i guess i am, but i don't even know if i want to be. without this condition why would anyone care about me? but with this condition it wouldn't matter if they did anyway, i'll have so much trouble just trying to accept that someone actually wants to be near me for some reason. of everything that i want, i want just a few things. i want to move far away from my family and never see them again so i don't have to be reminded of my past. i want to be a better person who's past doesn't define them, that way i can be myself and be okay around other people. and lastly, if i can get those other two things, then i want to be in a relationship with nice woman, someone who will support me and understand that i'm not always going to be okay, but i'll still try my best to support her. of course there's more to a relationship than that, but having someone who can be empathetic with me is definitely something i'm looking for. well, that's it for now. i want to apologize for this being so long and uncoordinated. i hope this doesn't make anyone feel bad, i know there's a bunch of negative things in this and i'm sorry about that. i really hope y'all are doing well.
storytime... hey, so... i've made some realizations in the shower as i do what most of us do and plan out the conversations i'll be having in two weeks because i know it's going to happen and i need to be ready or i'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. we've all been there, most of us are still there, let's talk about what i'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. alright, so i was showering, thinking about how akward it's going to be when i tell my friends some secrets. wow! i know, sharing secrets! it freaking sucks! so basically, i'm part of a church group, and these people are closer to me than my family because i don't like trust my family and being around them is stressful. these friends that i hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. though i don't share everything, these people are genuine and kind, and they always make me feel safe. it's just that, i am going on a mission trip with them this summer. going to africa, and it took them months to convince me to come with them. i still don't like the idea of going, but knowing that i'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. besides, i used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me. so, as part of going on the trip, i have to do a few things. one thing that i have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team 9 people including me . i trust, love, and feel safe with everyone on this team, and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. i couldn't ask for better friends. anyways, the presentation i'm giving is in two weeks and i'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. basically, i just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small mostly funny slideshow. it doesn't even have to last 5 minutes, but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. another thing that i'm going to have to do is share my testimony. that is essentially a summarized version of your life story. i'll have to talk about my troubles, my past, my family, all of it. and these are my friends, they'll know if i'm holding back. but it scares me so much! half of them don't actually know i have avpd! they just know that i've been going to therapy for a while and that i started taking medicine. though, the medicine is kind of iffy really. anyways, i'm super anxious about it, especially since i did something similar last year, but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. this time last year, i was so empty and emotionless. but of course, nobody knew. i was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. i didn't even know i was doing it, and when i gave my testimony for last year's mission, it was incomplete and full of holes. i talked about my lack of friends, but i was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because i had convinced myself that i was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. but it's not like that, that's not how i should think about my past pain. it took so long for my friends to break my barriers, but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy. i'm much better now, but i'm also not suppressing my emotions. it was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. one moment i was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking i was okay, but as soon as i was behind closed doors, i was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. the fact that i have to go and tell my friends how i've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming, but i am not allowed to go on this mission unless i share my testimony. it's only fair though, everyone of us is sharing our testimony, no matter how much it hurts, we're going to be here for each other. if you've actually read this far, i just want to say thank you. you're a special type of person, and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. and if they don't understand that, then know that i am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. thank you.
is aversion to physical touch affection cause anyone else to tense up and feel uncomfortable? hi, i'm not sure if this is an avpd thing or a cptsd thing... but i have a strong rejection of any physical touch that's comforting or affectionate. i'm permanently tense and hypervigilant and i now have a lovely dog who is so loving but i notice i basically reject her affection of leaning against me by tensing up. i've tried letting go and accepting the comfort of her touch but it leaves me feeling very strange and uneasy. my dog is very smart and notices the miniscule flexes of my muscles and my pushing back at her and will either walk away or try harder to 'love' me affiliate with me by persisting with her leaning against me with a little bit more weight. she's quite a teacher like that, and could maybe help me learn to accept love affiliation. the same has happened with professional physical massages. i would be 'body armouring' against the touch and tensing up and trying to push away the masseur instead of relaxing and accepting the physical touch and enjoying that experience. i have a feeling this is related to an early life trauma thing... but i was wondering if any one with avpd relates to this. i don't know why i feel so repulsed by physical contact it makes me feel squirmish and so uncomfortable, in danger almost.. often if i initiate it and am slightly dissociated i can do it. but there's a wall there preventing it from being too authentic or entirely organic, essentially going through the motions without mindfulness due to the layer of dissociation in the forefront. then there are other times when i can genuinely be affectionate for a short while, to my dog.. giving her a stroke or cuddle without being dissociated, instead mindful. however after a little while this is when i think avpd comes into play.... as i then start to think i suck at being affectionate and that my dog thinks i'm an idiot or annoying or needy or something. so total lack of self confidence comes into play my experience of touch is kind of like comforting a stranger in my experience , you're not 100 in the moment as you're not sure what to do to be there for them. except i'm like this with giving all friendly informal affectionate touch. and receiving it seems to scare me. it confuses me and makes me feel incredibly vulnerable and i rebel against it from the very core of my psyche and body. i can feel like a child perhaps toddler age.. inside me trying to fight off an opposing force.. when i am touched which makes me think it's a trauma cptsd thing. wish i knew how to work with it.. i get overwhelmed. no therapist currently.. things like i will start stroking the dog as it's happy to see me and wagging it's tail. but then when the tail stops wagging i'll instantly feel like i've done something wrong or the dog isn't enjoying the attention failure defective schemas or low self esteem simply . so i then try stroking her somewhere else or give up. gt i'm sure a therapist could help me navigate this quite easily. i do have times when it works, i can be affectionate and not crumble in failure if the dog is non responsive, i guess the other times i'm seeking validation that i'm being comforting? the times it works cohesively naturally are getting easier with practise... but i don't know any tools or practical ways to get better at it when i'm not feeling like it. most of the time i just want to be alone.. and this dog is very affectionate and i don't want to fail at being reciprocate. and of course this is all prelude to having human relationships.. which are infinitely more complex.
i despise my mom 22m pretty much the title i just can't stand her, i never liked her ever since i was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it. just to clarify, i don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way i put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are my things she isn't satisfied with the way i put my clothes in my wardrobe or when i don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy in the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open, even this days she complain when i don't leave a gap but on that case i don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kids people' because i don't act or do things they do, and i cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life, play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason. im afraid of embarrassing myself in public, im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because i don't think i can do it or i'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how i was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons i eat in my room is because i just don't want to be around her because i will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it, and my dad lives abroad , my ears, my hair, my clothes everything. she always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever i want regardless of her opinion picks i still remember that when i was younger she would be upset and mad if i didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as i said i still wear what i wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about, the way i behave why you are not smiling and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. she would always try to buy me stuff i don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something. when i think about all of this and other stuff i understand why im so incompetent, afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. it's not all her there are things i probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now i need to find a way to get back on track somehow. also, today i pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings i stored inside. i don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling. p.s if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this xd. im also sorry for possible grammar mistakes don't mind someone fixin them.
i think i may have avpd, anyone relate? i ve been in therapy on and off since 2015. i ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and bulimia. recently i ve been diagnosed with adhd too. though recently i ve been thinking something more is wrong with me. i ve been in therapy and been on meds since 2015 with med increases and it helps, but in stressful times or when i forget to take my meds i go back to the same thought patterns. recently they ve been coming up. what makes me think it s avpd because for the past decade and a half i ve always felt inadequate and not good enough, no matter what i do. it s rare for me to think i m good at something but even then i feel like i m bragging and being obtuse or being narcissistic. objectively i ve had success, i ve been to a reputable college and for grad school i went to an ivy league school but i feel like it s a fluke. i constantly feel like a nuisance and a burden. i regret and am critical with most of my reactions with other people and assume everyone is tired of me or thinks i m annoying even though no one says anything or gives me one statement like what s up with all the talking. i don t like to be the first one to call someone a friend because i want to make sure they feel like they are my friend. i don t want to impose myself on them and i assume they don t want to be my friend. even some of my friends now, i get into episodes where i assume they don t like me but because they re nice they tolerate me. i don t like to reach out to them first because i don t want to bother them. i don t follow up with friendships because i don t want to bother anyone. there s people that i loved to spend time with and liked them as a human but i don t want to bother them at all so i avoid. i don t really date. i ve had dating apps but i can only use them if i pay for the parts that lets me see who likes me first and then i go from there. regarding jobs working, initially i would take the first job offer i got because they wanted me, because i would assume i m not good enough for any other place. i tend to be the person, since high school, to primarily only speak until i m spoken to or is asked to speak, otherwise i stay quiet. i only have a handful of friends that i ve known for at least a decade that i ask to hang out, but otherwise i usually don t initiate conversations or social events. if i do it with high anxiety and expectation of rejection. criticism is also detrimental to me. i ve gotten better at it in the past year or so but it still just debilitates me. i feel like a failure and want to run away when i get criticism. so basically because i ve been like this since high school currently 30 i m thinking i have avpd. my job is social and interactive with people which makes it seem like i don t have it but my impostor syndrome is so high unless i get verbal confirmation from others that i m doing good. with everything else i assume i m a bad person and i need to isolate and or disappear with family and friends and coworkers. does anyone else relate? i have a therapist and i m going to bring this up. tl dr i think i have avpd because of my baseline fear of rejection, criticism, wanting to have close friends but feeling inadequate and or like a bad person, and i don t want to initiate friendships or relationships unless they confirm they want to be my friend and or like me. edit i think i m looking for anyone who thinks this might be avpd and or validation? idk
i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time, all i wanted is to be loved by other people, but as a depressed individual, it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know , but in the platonic sense too. i don't even think i'm physically unattractive, but i do know my personality is unattractive, which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love, i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests, i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains, charismatic people, etcetera . don't get me wrong, i love my weird quirky self, but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet, but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me, the people who will form groups with me, the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age, i feel like it's too late to find those skills, the skills of making deep, meaningful, reciprocal connections with other people. but i think that's okay. somehow, getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those small talk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job, with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much? the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful, even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart, and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now, i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed, and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed, help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed, i bathe myself and make myself some food. there's some days when loneliness hurts, though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love, of touching the lips of the person you would die for, feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends, as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with like minded people, and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live, and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism. but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay. you think you might find community, a sense of connection to something bigger, but you don t. in fact, you feel more alone than you did before you left but you survive. you learn that you can survive being alone. bojack horseman
why am i so scared of being seen? i cant tell if its avoidant personality disorder or body dysmorphia or a sick combination of both but i highly suspect i suffer from avpd. it just all makes so much fucking sense, too much honestly and it hurts to think that life will always be this painful. i feel like theres nothing i can do about it. ive always said i feel like an alien. that i feel like i experience being a human differently than everyone else is. because if everyone else was hurting as much as me, no way theyd be able to keep it to themselves. everyone would be crying all the time. and theyre not. so i must be the weird one. i have these online friends i wanna meet, known them for 11 years, and they only live a few hours away. theyve expressed interest several times and im just this freak who cant leave the house. the thought of them looking at me terrifies me. theyve seen me through a phone screen but what if in person im too ugly? realistically i know they wouldnt suddenly turn on me and start bullying or anything but the idea that the thought still might pop into their heads, something along the lines of oh, disappointing or at least i dont look like that its too much. its painful to think about. theres one friend who is pretty special to me. we met as kids through an online game, had a little flirty crush puppy love thing going on for a while but we grew up and didnt stay as close through the years, just checking in here or there but lately they have become one of the most important people ever to me. and those dumb childish feelings started coming back, only now i think its evolved into something more, and i seriously have been hopelessly pining after them for the past 3 years or so recently, they said they liked me. took me completely by surprise as i had been trying and failing miserably to get over them. so this should be great news. but nothing can happen now. we just expressed our mutual like and now we flirt a little here and there but they said they dont think they can be in a romantic relationship right now, yet they keep initiating all of the flirting, and they mentioned how its hard not seeing me because if we could hang out things would be easier. which makes a lot of fucking sense. but this is also all very confusing. im stuck. im terrified. im ugly theyve seen my face and know that im fat but theyve never really seen me. not fully. not from every angle. not up close. not in person. im anticipating the rejection, the disgust, and its too much i wanna hold onto this idea in my head of us living happily ever after. and changing the relationship will probably end in disaster. they said they need my friendship and that theyre scared this could ruin things. im scared too. im scared they ll see me and any feelings of like will fade completely. and if i tell them this, im scared it will only speed up the process. they talk about wanting to kiss me and things like that and ive never done anything with anyone. 12 yr old me is freaking out, i always hoped they would be my first back then lmao so many firsts i wanna have and im scared it will mean too much to me and not them. how do i express this? do i even try? how the fuck do i get over this and go see them? i need to see them. i need them. i need i need i need i need help. can anyone talk to me?
how to gently ghost an avoidant without making feel them guilty? so, throwaway because i m afraid she might be in this sub. before asking the real question, long story short tldr at the end so me 22m and this girl 20f matched on tinder a year ago, we want on a date and then she ghosted me the day after. tried to talk to her one day after few months, got a single message reply and then she disappeared again. at the end of last year i notice she was on hinge saying she broke up with her bf, so i started posting instagram stories that she might ve been find interesting, and she started liking them, so after a while i reached out to her and wishing a happy new year. she seemed kinda interest, so we made plans for the following week. she ghosted me again. i was disappointed. after few days i noticed she had put me back in the close friends she removed me from it after the first ghosting so i thought mh she might be to ashamed to write me back after all this time, i ll reach out again and since then we never stopped talking anymore, but here comes the problem. we just talked for a couple months, i tried not to push anything to don t let her make uncomfortable and run away again, but she basically is just venting on me, and now she started venting also about male friends on and on, so i got suspicious, and i was right, she s back on hinge with a fresh new verified and recently active profile. now here comes the problem, and i don t mean her being on hinge, at least not directly. she s in therapy and on meds, i m pretty sure her therapist wouldn t suggest her to be on hinge correct me if i m wrong . she said she couldn t drink cause of meds and of med swings, but few days ago she started hanging out at night she couldn t do it before hanging out with me couple weeks ago with a male friend and wanted to get drunk . she said she s to anxious to hang out with people outta blue . we were talking about hanging out again, said she was super busy, got even more busy with college lessons, but she found the to hang out with somebody else, while i m being her emotional support for the last 2 3 months didn t text me back for couple days after hanging out with that guy so the real question is how do i gently end up things with her? i don t want to make feel her guilty, but i can t keep stressing myself this much i thought she d made progress with her therapist, but apparently she isn t doing much of what they says, so i think she might be helpless and toxic, and mostly we aren t on the same page, i truly love her and i think she knows but she s playing with me and using me just to vent and for not feeling completely lonely tldr after being ghosted multiple times with a girl with avpd, adhd and probably bpd too i m referring what she said to me , we seemed to bond for once, but she might be a toxic person and i don t think i don t want keep pursuing this anymore , i d like to slowly walk away without hurting both of us. she probably know i m in love with her and she s playing me. even if i d come out and we d make things work quite impossible imho i m not sure she might be a good fit. sorry for language mistakes and for the format, but i m from mobile
my strange two sided life hi i'm 25 m new to to this subreddit and also to reddit. i am not diagnosed with avpd so far but i am able to relate to almost all the posts here. my parents are loving but the rest of the family on my dad's side is fucked up. my dad and his siblings are all suffering from some or the other disorder not all are diagnosed though because no one takes mental health seriously in my family . everyone's super self centred to the core. but it is the exact opposite on my mom's side. all of my mom's siblings, cousins and their kids get along great, while i feel like an outsider. i was terribly bullied in middle school because i reflected the behaviour i saw back at home. also because i had started watching porn. this went on for a few years. i learnt to build a shell around my myself to prevent people from seeing my true self. this shell has hardened to such an extent that nobody, i repeat, nobody has access to the person within. i have since been the mature kid in school and focussed primarily on academics. i made it to one of the best universities in my home country. a couple of years into university, i realised that i had a lot of friends but there was no one i could truly call a close friend. no one knew anything about me. i collaborated with a lot of people, both academically and in extracurricular activities but never got close enough to anyone. at that time i didn't think much of it, mainly because i was doing well according to the norm. i bagged some great internships and a well paying job right out of college. interestingly, this did not seem to affect my job. i performed exceptionally well and received great reviews, both in the technical and interpersonal front. but as you might have guessed it already, no one knew me out of work. again, i ignored this and remained focussed on my work. then i decided to go for a master's and got accepted into one of the top graduate schools in the us. i have completed a term here. i started noticing this problem again during my first term after meeting and talking to people. it's not like i can't come up with things to talk about, but everything seems very superficial. there is no intimacy in any of the conversations. also it feels like people behave differently when they talk to me. i am not really interested in people's life and it is extremely exhausting to pretend otherwise. what's sad is that from the outside it looks as though i'm doing great and living the best life. there are people that look up to me and dream to achieve what i have achieved. but no one knows the truth, not even my parents. this post is the most candid i have ever been in my life. i don't reveal anything about myself to anyone. i have never been in a relationship and at this rate i'm afraid i will never be. i want to turn my life around before it's too late. i'm not sure how my family would react to therapy. i don't have enough money to fund it myself. to end this vent, the details i have added in this post are not intended for bragging. i totally understand that people have suffered worse. those are just to emphasize what an absolutely perfect, two sided mess my life has become.
does anyone know if avpd would qualify for maid in canada when it opens to mental health conditions? in march medical assistance in dying is opening up for people with conditions causing unbearable pain, physical or mental, they do not have to life threatening. https www.ontario.ca page medical assistance dying and end life decisions https www.ontario.ca page medical assistance dying and end life decisions i've gone over this at least a hundred times, like tonight, even if i get approved they have a new 90 day minimum waiting period so it will be a while regardless. i have to time to think which leads to all fun ideas of wiley coyote jumping off my balcony and hitting the concrete awning over the front entrance, 12 stories might kill ol' wiley, maybe, or leave him in agonizing pain, wishing for death. imagine holding that little sign up to the camera, but it's a little suicide note saying goodbye to no one. haha but i'm pretty confident i'm going to get approved, i meet very criteria, i've tried all the required mental health options, counselling, therapy, community services, etc. i don't have any psychological supports, i am alone. that's more than half the reason i want to go, this condition, this brain, it makes it so i will always be alone. the loneliness, knowing you can never and never will escape, you'll avoid every chance you have. but the pain doesn't have to be forever, i don't have to keep suffering, and if i don't get approved jokes on them. i don't need approval to kill myself, i just know i'm going to fuck it up anyway. ending up with my ankles snapped off, trying to crack my skull open on the concrete but too fucking weak to get the pressure. i couldn't do it if i tried, not because i don't want too. i want too, i want too so bad, that's why i'm applying for maid, but i need to do it. but i will fail because i always fail. i'll avoid because i always avoid. i'll pity myself and feel bad and get fucked up and cry and hurt myself and tomorrow will happen and my credit card will get more maxed out and death will come knocking again saying today is the day do it do it fucking do it please do it. constantly. that's my brain, thousands of times a day screaming kill yourself. i love saying slit your wrists over and over again. making tea, i should slip my fucking wrists, dum dum dum please slit your wrists. i don't even have a good knife, i just say it for some reason to myself. i'm way less scared of cutting that jumping, i am terrified of fucking that up. damn hamilton's and our slow trains lmao. that was the way i wanted to go when i was trying to do it as a teenager. the trains back home, damn they were fast, knock your fucking head off in one go. instant. there were always roses taped to the red sign beside the opening. a lot of people had the same idea as me, so at least you know it works right! but you can always fuck it up, the fear that causes avoidance affects suicide too! i can't do it if i wanted to, just like everything else in life i want to do. so if i just need to get approved, get passed 90 days... ahh i'm fucked lmao. where's the nearest train station haha
i feel out of place, no matter how much i try i recently signed up for uni, and the first two weeks have been okay, if only i'm only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them. i still managed to befriend two or three people. i try my best to talk to them, but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didn't want to greet me or they didn't want to talk to me or they're talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting. so i end up feeling out of place because i can't gather the courage to talk more, while they all befriend each other. despite all of these feelings, i kept pushing through and this last weekend i managed to ask one of my classmates friends who i considered myself to be the closest to to hang out, and they accepted. it went well, we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun. but when i came back home, all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didn't really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice, or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me, realizing i'm more of a nuisance and a bore than it's worth to keep around started consuming my mind. i tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as i could, but today i already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind. i saw my friend ? enter class, but i couldn't bring myself to talk to them. not even a single greeting, nothing, and i felt like a piece of shit for not trying more, because surely they thought i was rude for not saying anything. they were talking normally to other people during break time, and i envied all of them. i wish i could talk so easily with other people, befriending them. i wish i wouldn't be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored. so i ended up feeling out of place, again, despite my desires to fit in. i thought maybe at least we'd have the chance to talk after class. no. all i could manage to mutter was a half cut word before they said goodbye, even if smiling, and walked up to someone else to talk to them. my logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class, but my avpd says they absolutely hate me and don't want to do anything with me anymore. i feel like i messed up big time and that i lost a potential friend. i feel like i lost all my chances of having friends ever again, even. and i know it's my fault because i should have talked more, but when i talk more i'm scared to scare them all away. i hate how hard it is to simply say 'hello' and ask someone how they're doing. i feel like i'll be seen as a weirdo and ignored, even if the person is a friend. so i don't know what to do. sorry for the long rant. sorry if i used the wrong flair, too, i don't normally post anywhere. i just really needed to vent.
married ex coworker stress so, there's a situation that occurred and it's tearing me apart from the inside. i'm absolutely terrible at showing emotions and making a move. hence my terminal aloneness. i wish it was terminal... last year, during the summer i temporarily got to experience what it was like to be wanted. a coworker and i became friends, and she seemed to express interest in me. time and time i'd go hang out with her, only to go home banging my head in frustration and wondering wtf was going on. here's my only other post about her, for reference https www.reddit.com r avpd comments w1us95 situation involving married coworker ?utm source share amp utm medium android app amp utm name androidcss amp utm term 1 amp utm content share button tldr of old post she's married, but they are about to separate over issues they've had for years. for those that think i'm being scummy, maybe. but she's leaving the country for good next month, without him. meanwhile, she's seemingly expressed interest in me while at the same time holding me at arms length away. she tells me all of these personal things about herself, including some secrets she says she's never told anyone. however, if she gives me a hug, it's half hearted most of the time. but with other guys, like the one she said weirded her out, she is willing to fully embrace them. here's a worse part, i have a car and she can't drive. so when she needed things she'd pretend to want to hang out and go check something out. usually then, we'd go back to her place and she'd cook something for me, and i wouldn't feel it was a total loss getting food for the gas spent. but the last two times i went over there she kept going on and on about how tired she was so i left. basically, having been used as a free uber. but here's the worst part! the other day, on valentine's day, i called her up and she's busy chatting with strangers on omegle. this one guy is flirting with her and she keeps telling me about how good he looks... and how he wants to do an online video date with her clothes optional. the whole time she's giggling and basically ignoring what i'm saying. so i say i've got something to do and hang up. she has the fucking nerve to call me back and want a ride somewhere before she goes home to get some rest. i keep it short and civil what choice do people like us have? and basically hang up and go to bed. the next day i texted her to ask how did your little e date go? she responded huh? and i haven't talked to or heard from her since. highly unusual because she always calls me several times on my 2 days off. those days are over and i feel an incredible amount of stress about it.. my heart is going crazy and i feel like i'm waiting to get punished by the principle or something. i guess i lost whatever that was.. life never wastes an opportunity to kick me when i'm down.
this is really getting out of control i feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. i feel like everything i do, could have been done better, and that i am inadequate. my avoidance is getting worse to the point where i am unable to do anything at all. as a medical student, i chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. now, during my clinical rotations, every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. i constantly feel judged, and i fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. this constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that i have worked so hard to achieve. i am always reserved and quiet, and i do not act on anything until i know there is no other option, fearing that i will be blamed for my incompetence. however, this has backfired on me, as i struggle to form connections and networks, losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. gradually, people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible, which makes me feel hopeless. what can i do to sustain balance, at least in my mind? in addition to this, i am lonely, and the effect on my already damaged mental health is apparent. last year, i met a group of people with whom i shared similar interests. socializing with them was enjoyable, and i felt liked. but, in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group, i ended up stressing over whether i was making them uncomfortable, whether i had anything interesting to say, and whether they looked down on me. the gut wrenching anxiety became too much to bear, and i ended up quitting. i limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. though i am still in contact with them on social media, i see how new people have joined the group, formed close friendships, and i continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them. i am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. though i have always been indifferent about relationships, sometimes i think that i am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. there were guys who took an interest in me because i had this mysterious aura around me, but after a few more dates, i was still the same person they met on the first day. i had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. every time i wanted to go deeper, i felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. so, it's definitive for me that i have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on. i'm sorry if i went on for too long or sounded negative, but i really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand. thank you for taking the time to read this post.
the urge to disappear and start over. first i want to say that i am not diagnosed. i've seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on r schizoid https www.reddit.com r schizoid and also r avpd https www.reddit.com r avpd . i am kind of glad that i am not the only one who does this. i constantly delete my social media and start over. by doing this i also ghost all of my friends on discord. with social media like reddit, twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because i don't post anything. i only keep my steam account. i always knew it's not normal. i didn't know other people also struggle with this. my friends are annoyed whenever i come up with a new discord account. i really don't want to talk to them about this. it's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people i know. i feel like they wouldn't understand me and or would judge me. most of my friends i've known since 2017. i usually just come up with a dumb excuse like i forgot my password or something like that. i want to explain the weird urge i get whenever i feel like disappearing. under a post there was this comment gt there was a point where i realized i was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point i would get that urge to restart. not just with accounts, but with everything. i'd plan out how i was going to use an account, build a new habit, accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible, and for a while follow through. eventually i would drift off track a little, let it eat at me, and then give up and decide i'll start over and do it better. at this point i struggle to get to the i'm going to try stage and usually just don't bother. the apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more. this comment describes my situation very accurately. i feel almost exactly as this guy. creating new accounts has become a routine. i feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. it's kind of hard to explain how i feel.. i ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. throughout the weeks i've tried to start over, but i always fail and just start over once again.. i didn't tell anyone i'll disappear. i deleted my discord and now i'm gone. my friend texted me on snapchat asking why i deleted my account. i just responded with something like yeah lol . didn't even give an answer. ever since then i haven't talked to them. i want to, but i know i'm gonna disappear after a month. i also don't want to explain to them why i deleted my account because i can't even do it right now where i am anonymous. probably a lot of mistakes, very unorganized post but yeah.. i hate this. i just want to be normal.
how do you even expose yourself to the public or gain experience when you are 30 ? i have been hiding from people for so long. even when i was going to school i was finding ways to hide from the world. i got sad again and randomly searched avoidance on youtube and one video that popped up was from this guy called dr. k. i guess he's a popular mental health streamer on twitch and a psychiatrist who works at harvard. i don't really play video games anymore, but i do think i have an internet addiction. back in the day i definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people, so i do relate to those who have gaming addiction avoidance. a lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. he talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass, but on the other hand, i can see a lot of introverted, smart, but shy types gravitating towards games. a lot of the people i knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people, even the lazy ones who never amounted to anything in life. now, the part that i wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. he mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life, so they don't really struggle early in life, but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. their self conscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. what a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience, not intelligence in order to succeed. i looked up dr. k's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in india. he came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. so i guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works. but what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? he had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. again, this could be due to experience and desensitizing himself, but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. for someone like me, my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that. i find that a lot of success stories ignore that the people who were struggling were not as extreme as a lot of people like myself.
need to vent. i have had a partner for 4 years. it s a shock to me, as well. but we haven t had the greatest past. to make a very long story short when he started medical school 4 years ago, when we first started dating , he wasn t that nice to me. some might say he was abusive towards me, especially when he drank. anyway, he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. it turned everyone in his life against me. now, my partner has sobered up. it took me a while to trust and accept this change. but the people in his life still haven t let go of the past. and the truth is, neither have i. i ve forgiven my partner but i haven t forgotten how everyone else treated me, even after my partner tried to clear my name. it only augmented the characteristics of my avpd. it dissuaded me from applying to grad school, seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly, it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because i simply don t trust anyone anymore. today, my partner found out where he matched for residency. his school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. so my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since they re in the same class. keep in mind that i haven t seen anyone in about 2 3 years. after panicking for a week before the event, i finally mustered up the courage to go. i convinced myself it s not going to be bad. my partner actually reassured me a lot, as well. well . aside from my partner, everyone acted like i was invisible. they went out of their way to hug and greet everyone, and then skipped right over me. even when i spoke, they wouldn t acknowledge me. my partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light, so he didn t confront anyone. he did stick by my side, so i was at least grateful for that. it all just augmented my social anxiety, avoidant personality, and even my body dysmorphia. looking at the pictures i took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me . i m really struggling to decide if it s just a bad day or if i m really that hideous. it makes me never want to step foot outside again. my partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. i love him very much and am proud that he s grown up a lot during our relationship. yes, ideally we would ve never had to go through our dark phase. but he s helped me in many ways too. i just wish the people in his life were nicer to me. they have no idea what their rejection does to me.
i can't cope with my job i work from home as a software developer, most aspects of the job are too triggering, and i can t handle it. every morning starts with a daily update meeting. since i usually had done only 0 30 minutes of work the previous day, i have no update to give, i panic and have to lie, and the lie is transparent. afterwards i have to cool down from the shame, guilt, and stress. it s already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything i do, with the code or on slack, has a timestamp, a notification, and is visible to everyone. once there s something i m avoiding committing code, deploying code, posting the code for review, responding to someone, testing code, an upcoming meeting, etc. i often go offline from inactivity, and then i m afraid to even open my laptop which can take hours to overcome because once i do everyone can see i m online on slack my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people i m not responding to, my manager. i already got in trouble for not doing my work, missing meetings, not responding to people for days or weeks, and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. i was put on a month long probation, which i ve gotten past only because i didn t ghost entire days during that time. i have frequent meetings with my manager and i have to pretend i m struggling way less than i am. i can t admit that half or more of the days i do absolutely nothing, or how much communicating with people the most important part of the job so fundamentally terrifies me. i know every trick in the book about procrastination, time management, breaking down tasks, but that s not enough when i m this afraid of people. i ve accepted i need help from another person. i ve talked about this some with friends, but none of them understand, so all they can provide is sympathy. i have a psychiatrist and i ve been trying to find a therapist, but they ve all been unhelpful, many actively harmful. i know it's a slow process, but every single day at work is like torture, and i m on very thin ice. because i can t get the work done, it s not endurable, and i don t have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. i don t want to quit because i haven t been here that long and i had a big gap between quitting my previous job for the same reasons . but i can t stay like this for months until i find someone and begin making progress. i don t know what to do
narcissistic mom uses family pet as a weapon i don't live with my her anymore so she has less power but she likes to use my bond with the family dog as a weapon. my vulnerable narcisstic brother over 30yo ''pretends'' not to like the dog, he doesn't actually hurt the dog but he pretends not to like it and the dog can sense it and feels confused. he moves between this and making a joke about it in front of others to cover himself that it is just purely an act. for example, i know he will have some pictures taken with the dog showing that he likes the dog so if anything were to happen he would play victim. yet he will keep them hidden my nmon knows my brother does this out of insecurity towards me and she plays to it, when i speak to her on the phone she will bring my, brother, into the conversation even when i was not talking about him she pretends to mishear that id asked him a question just so he can say something like''' im just busy punching the dog' then my nmom gleefully says back to me he says he's says he is punching the dog, and she does this to make sure i say something back so they get the reaction their looking for even though she knows i can hear perfectly well what he said. i dont take the bait but says something to move the conversation along like'' sounds pretty lame''. they do this routine all the time in different ways and my nbrother has even started a new one where he jokes about getting ready for his fight with me and my nmon plays to this aswell, encouraging the imaginary conflict and trying to bait me into saying something back that escalates the situation. of course again if anything were too happen i would be blamed regardless of the outcome cause it's all just a joke after all. making vague threats of violence and beng low key mean to the dog. my nmon has done this in the past with her ex bf she would vaguely threaten me with him and she would encourage them to ''step up'' and argue with me when they didn't really want too. that led to a fight one time with her bf confronted my youngest brother and cornered him in the bathroom he came out crying and said he got punched which led me to react and a fight. my bro lied, he was just scared . i ended up getting arrested and blamed for the whole situation, the bf holds deep grudge against me because the trauma so i have to avoid certain family gatherings where he is there. even though my nmom orchestrates the whole thing. just wanted someone to share this with as its quite depressing
what i see on instagram is real and it's killing me inside a self pitying post for your viewing pleasure stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada i know!!!! i know i know better! but. i'm sick of being told they only show the happy moments. no shit. but they have happy moments. they have adventures with friends that they post every other week, or even just every month, and some of them even post every week or more. i'm in my early 20s and so many people i went to high school with are traveling the world before they're tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart mine already is... . not because they're rich but because they're simply financially comfortable and have connections with people social skills . and because they're not afraid to take risks. and because they've built a life for themselves, an identity, since early on in high school, maybe even earlier, which makes doing all of this feel normal to them, makes it all so much easier for them. and if they're not traveling, they're still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfs bfs. or they're performing in a band at local venues and they're actually good now . or they're about to graduate college. envy kills me. i'm so fucked up, i took a gap year to figure out what i want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because i still feel too directionless. and i know i could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only i would get off my ass instead of sulking. i actually just checked more like stalked because i'm not following any of these people instagram for the first time in months. hurt even more than it did the last time. and in those months where i stopped looking at their lives, did mine improve? did pretending they aren't living happy, fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better? contrary to what every mental health guru genius on reddit claims no, it didn't make my life any better. i'm still stuck. i try my hardest every day and i'm still stuck. sure. i've finally had a job at this point in my life retail, but i snapped and quit . i can drive now, though i hate it. i can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping, not that i have money to spend. and yet it's nothing. it means nothing because it's not enough. not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people.
therapy or attachment therapy? 50 something gay man here. while i ve been in therapy for most of my life, because i was always dealing with dysthymia persistent depression, attachment issues were never discovered or diagnosed. a year ago, tms put my depression into remission, which has been amazing. awesome. endless superlatives. however.... with pdd no longer fouling the view, surprise surprise, i see now that dismissive avoidant attachment has been playing merrily in my psyche, my attention having been elsewhere. i've never had a real deep, intimate sexual relationship. sex yes. friends, yes, but again, none particularly deep. distancing. closed off. difficulty trusting. from what i can tell, da has influenced, inhibited, even impaired a lot of areas of my life. i d like to fix or improve those if i can. to be honest, i m a bit concerned read scared that i won t be able to do that. da is a hard one to move to secure attachment. from reading, it looks like it basically takes an intimate sa partner and therapy to change an attachment style. since i haven't even had a crappy intimate relationship, that seems unlikely. lol i have therapist right now. we ve talked a bit about this. he s not an expert certified in attachment therapy. cognitive behavioral? yes. general support, especially with the tms stuff, yes. given the seeming intractability of da, i'm wondering if he's right for tackling this? i know da is an error in cognition but it s also wrapped up in feelings and in behaviors that i m not even aware of. trauma. family of origin stuff. there's a lot that goes into da. and while i've tackled much of this in regular therapy, i've never come at it from an attachment angle, with someone who specialized in attachment theory and styles so, in your opinion, is it better to have a therapist that specializes in attachment issues or is that not necessary? will an attachment group or class suffice? is changing therapists reasonable here i'm up for doing that or is that idea someone just another sign of avoidant dismissing behavior? while i ain t dead and have no plans on dying anytime soon or later, for that matter i would like to fix this da before i shuffle off. along those lines, i d like to stumble and fail at a real relationship or two i know da is hard to lessen on the off chance that i just succeed at one. i want to improve my life. i m just trying to figure out the best way to go at it. any advice here would be great.
do you think this a good description of our experiences? this is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called on the outside looking in by daniela grazia, about her experiences with social anxiety. i ve used it to describe my experiences to others, but i have both social anxiety and avpd so i worry if i m not explaining from the correct side ? . i m also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. i suppose it only matters in my head, but it does matter. the quote one long one, formatting issues gt it is a feeling that comes over me often, an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. in classes, in coffee shops, in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. it is the profound feeling of alienness. gt at any moment in the group conversation, something in me snaps. i look around the table at the other people blissfully talking, and i do not feel like one of them. i am not one of them. i am different, a foreigner, an alien, a stranger in a strange land. gt and then the urge to run away, to hide, to be away from the people comes up. sometimes i fight the urge and stay on, hiding my vast discomfort. other times i do run away, cursing the cowardice and the shame, miserable in my misanthropy, but secure in my solitude. gt there is something in the faces, in the voices of the others that i do not have. they are into the conversation. they live outside themselves, i live inside myself. they talk, listen, and laugh i think, listen, and smile. gt they are relaxed. i am not. i am never relaxed, except when i m alone. solitude is the only place where i can ever truly be known. gt yet i am not content with this. for the real me is lonely, desperately lonely, longing for intimacy, friendship and love. i long to be able to relax, to laugh, to talk, and converse amiably with other human beings. but i cannot. i idealize them in private and fear them in public. gt fear...fear drives the haunted mind. fear tortures me, gnaws at me, and chases me from nearly everything i crave the most. but not even fear can conquer the longing, the desperate longing, the aching striving for meaning in life, for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged, the dreams unshared, the life unnoticed. gt when i am alone, i wish i was other people. when i am with other people, i wish i was alone. this contradiction is slowly, but ruthlessly destroying my soul.
expressing myself i feel like i ve had a realization in the last few months that i wanted to share. it s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort. i used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that i built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. basically just the fake it til you make it strategy . although i became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as i was never able to get close to people. now i am back to an ultimately isolated life. but i m trying something different. it s very challenging to me and not always doable but i think it is necessary. and that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. when i have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way for better or worse . also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. this may sound silly but i think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal. as i said it s challenging and not always doable, this is because 1. a deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection. 2. my brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express. 3. the fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down. but regardless i realize that this is what i have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what s on my mind is the only way forward. usually what happens when i force something out is that i brace for impact. brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. usually i assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever i said, but whether or not that is true isn t important. i ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and i think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally. anyway, i m tired of pretending. im not sure if i will ever be able to speak without fear and shame, but at least i won t have to strain myself into a safe caricature. maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but i hope someone relates or understands.
feeling like an empty body with nothing inside. i m a 24 year old female and i never developed my own personality. i also suspect i have autism because i did a lot of research and i just know my brain is wired differently. i can t hold friendships and i hurt them because i keep them on a distance. they can t help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. because of this i have a lot of trauma s. when i was a kid i was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. i lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause i tried to commit suicide. it wasn t a serious attempt. i just didn t know how to get out of the situation. anyway i m 24 now and i ve learned a lot so far. between my 18 22 i did a lot of drugs and i felt normal . i felt like people wanted to be friends with me because i was social and talkative and not scared at all. but deep down i knew it was fake. the friendships i build were fake. i tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. and next to that i was in an abusive relationship. i was paranoid and stressed. always scared they d find out the real me. and i did this for so long i don t even remember who i am right now. i am depressed, diagnosed with ptsd, avpd and traits of borderline disorder. i asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didn t think i have enough traits to fit the criteria. i don t really care about labels but i feel like there is something really wrong with me. i m an alien in this world. it feels so alone. sorry for the long text. i m prone to addiction and im addicted to xanax right now. i get admitted to a rehab clinic this friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to portugal for intense therapy. i m glad to have this opportunity and i ll definitely get out of my comfort zone. i know they won t fix my problems but it ll hopefully give me the push i need to work hard. cause i do believe i can find out who i am and make real friends without being fake. i have hope and i want you to have it too we re all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important getting out of your comfort zone. do things that are scary. take baby steps. don t set the bar too high for yourself. everyone is different so you can t compare yourself to others. good luck everyone and just keep swimming
autism and avpd crossover? hi, so i'm diagnosed with autism, and years ago about 14 i was diagnosed with social anxiety as well. i recently found out about avpd and i feel like i relate to the majority of symptoms i've found. i checked on the autism subreddit about this, but i found someone arguing that you can't diagnose people with autism and avpd because it's so hard to tell. which confused me. i'm currently 17, turning 18 in september. i attend a sixth form college, but that is literally the only place i go. i have no remaining friends, even though i really want close friends, and people have tried to make friends with me. i really avoid making friends though, bc i feel so awkward and uncomfortable and trying to interact with people makes me so tired that i can't cope with it. but its a constant struggle between feeling so lonely and really not wanting to talk to anyone. i can't tell if this is specifically just autism or maybe avpd, because i find a lot of autistic people don't actually avoid making friends, rather just struggle to. i can't go anywhere by myself, i've never been to a shop alone before because of who i could have to speak to or if anything went wrong. i feel sick at the idea of actually approaching people or speaking in a group. i can rarely text, i can't make phone calls and i don't like going out, so i lose friends pretty quick, because i essentially ghost them, even when i don't mean to. this is one of the main reasons i don't want to make new friends, because i know i'm not a great friend. in the future, i plan on doing a job either part time or from home because i can't cope with interacting with people. at school, in my free periods, i can't even stand sitting in the same room as others, especially if they're talking. and i can't eat in front of others. i feel like i'm on show. these don't apply to my parents or my older sister. if i'm with them, these are easier. originally i thought it was just being autistic, or social anxiety or agoraphobia maybe. but then i found out about avpd. it definitely could just be autism. but i feel so isolated and lonely, but i dont want to be around anybody, and i can't bare the thought of this being my entire life without any chance of it getting better. could anyone maybe just tell me if you have any similar experiences or advice? i'm just not sure what to do.
feeling like i don't do enough i'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not, if it's imposter syndrome, if it's from old christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood, or if it's a combination of all three but i often feel like i don't do enough for other people in my life. whether it's with other family members, close friends, or co workers, i often get this sense. i work from home. and i've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. but now that we're sitting near the finish line, almost ready to go live with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover, i can't help but feel some kind of guilt like i'm not doing enough. even though i helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. with friends or family it often comes in the form of should i be there? or i know i be there, be present, but i really don't want to and then i just feel like a pos terrible friend sibling son etc. for not doing it. for example, a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. naturally, i didn't go. i'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. nonetheless i still felt like an asshole for skipping. especially later when i talked to my dad and asked how it went i asked who was there? and he said just about everyone. except for you . i don't think he intended to make me feel guilty, but it kind of did. my mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it, but nonetheless i felt like i didn't do enough. even though, again, this relative having the child and i don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. another example is a friend, a close friend, who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. they'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants, and 9 times out of 10 i don't go. part of me appreciates the hell out of that, because i need it, and it's nice to be included wanted. another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone because i don't think i'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. then i start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder, or if it's something else. anyone else experience this?
my future feels so hopeless. i'm 28 years old, my resume is useless, haven't worked in 2 years, and i am very avoidant of the world hi there. i have been depressed since i was 12 years old. i am now 28. i also struggle with bpd, social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder, afraid to leave the house by myself, reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance, and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. i have tried and tried to work. several different fields. even part time. it always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so i had to quit. i am worried, i feel my future is really hopeless. i love my husband so much. we wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. i am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything. i know that is so much. that is definitely something to be grateful for. but we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out. nothing really brings me happiness except substances, and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and i've been mostly sober for a year. i see a therapist. i take medications. i just... i am not content in life. i am constantly worried about everything. i constantly feel like i'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. i stay in bed about 70 of my days because i feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless. i don't have many friends and live in a small town, so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. and since i don't work and am not in school, no opportunities to make many friends. i do have one so i can try to branch out with her friends maybe. it feels like life is just about working. and i feel so depressed by the state of everything, and by my worries that things won't improve in the future. things don't get better. not if you don't work for them. and i have worked, i've tried so many treatments, but the one thing i rarely do is go out in the world. and i don't know if i can do that without a lot of help that i don't know if i can find. please if you can relate at all, or have any advice, please please respond. lt 3 i'm desperate.
i came off as an asshole today and i m struggling with it i went to the mall to buy some fragrances and i came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. there was originally only one girl that was attending the area i went to, so i thought i would be fine. wrong. she seemed like she was new and when i asked her for the fragrance i wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. she came back with two women, and they re all staring at me while i say what i want. then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions, i wasn t prepared for this and i sort of shut down. she asked me what i was currently wearing and i lied and said i didn t wear anything currently, then she asked me if i would wear something sweeter than the fragrance i had picked out and i just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. i acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because i was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. i wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so i grabbed a different fragrance that i was familiar with and told them i would just buy that. i had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person, because the last time i went there was only one person i had to talk to. talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and i acted like a dismissive asshole. i thought it would be really easy for me since i already knew what i wanted and i assumed i could just tell the lady the name of what i wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. i also feel really bad for the new girl because i could tell she didn t really know what she was doing and i just made it worse for her. and the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and i feel bad for acting the way i did. now that i think about it, the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and i ruined it for her. i had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but i will probably only buy them online from now on. this experience made me realize that i also act cold and asshole ish to everyone that s not the people i live with, or my mom. but that s also the only way i can speak to people, so i m kind of stuck between don t socialize at all or act cold to everyone.
it s impossible to think for myself. i ve always been 100 selfless. i put everyone first and i don t give myself the time of day for nearly anything. there have only been a few times where i ve stood up and tried to prioritize myself and it always ended in a dumpster fire. i always get put down, by others and myself. i feel like the universe is trying to punish me for trying to care about myself. i ve been looking into what i want to do career wise and i m leaning towards my dream job and becoming a mortician. i ve never told anyone about my interest in the job because i know people will be very judging about it. i was talking to my mom earlier about career stuff and i got brave enough and told her about it. you can probably guess how she reacted. but she didn t nearly react as harsh enough as my dad did. he walked into the room as we were talking and mom looked at him and went she wants to be a mortician . he instantly stopped moving and stared at me for 2 whole minutes with this absolute disgust on his face. he already made me feel like a disappointment without him opening his mouth yet. after what seemed like an eternity he said in a low and disgusted tone you re kidding me then slowly turn around and walked away like i pissed him off or something. people have reacted in that similar fashion to a lot of my interests. i know that field of work is looked in a taboo way by some people but i haven t had such an unsettling, judgmental, self esteem killing reaction like that in a while. i don t know why it hit me as hard as it has but it did. how am i going to be able to function if i can t handle people reacting about what my passions are like that? every time i try to climb out of this abyss, i get hit with the tiniest pebble of judgment and it causes me to lose my grip and fall down deeper than i was before and the cycle just continues. i feel so stupid thinking i could pull it off. i actually thought i could go into a job like this. i m honestly giving up. i m just going to stick to what i m good at most of the time and just stay quiet. i m never gonna get anywhere in life without avpd reminding me that all i m good at is telling people what they want to hear and stay in my room.
feel like a leech sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and this is one of them https m.youtube.com watch?v wjxiuzvgjp8 . my mother would tell me i m exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. she called me a sociopath, someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. that i tried to purposely ruin my family s lives. like i had a secret agenda that even i couldn t know about. it s been the foundation of all of my relationships with others, and helps explain why i get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. trying to connect while thinking i m secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that i m taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. that everything i say is actually calculated and manipulative, despite me being unaware of this. that my side of the story isn t just shameful and wrong, it s evil and vile. avoidant with bpd is contradictory hell. i m hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships i can keep so they don t leave me. i m unbelievably stressed because i m so close to disaster. i hate to vent to my best friend of several years because i feel like i m being too greedy of her time. i feel like i m sucking off all the meat of this relationship, taking up the space for my troubles, and then i don t even improve. i know she s going to leave when she discovers i m actually a terrible person and that i don t change. i can feel it creeping towards me and i want to die. i feel like she s only my friend because she falsely believes i have potential. i feel like i ve somehow manipulated her into thinking i m a nice person. i feel like i m so much worse than she thinks. i can t understand why someone would care about me, other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. i can t believe the situation i m in. it happens every single time, and i never learn. i get her texts saying i need to try to get help and i just want to sink into the ground and die. i feel like i ve done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. the answer is simple stop avoiding therapy. actually tell the therapist the truth. everyone is sick of me including me.
the worst part is the lack of hope i m always gonna be like this. even with years of therapy and meds, even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing and anxiety reducing drugs, i m still too socially anxious and awkward. sure i can force myself to socialise but i can t force myself to enjoy it, or force myself to relax and just be myself. the fact that this shit isn t getting any better no matter what i try is so demoralising, it makes everything else pointless, having severe avpd social anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. i can t hold a job, i can t make friends, i haven t talked to a girl in years, never mind having a relationship. my anxiety is so bad i get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen, or hearing others use voice chat in video games. and as i said, sure i could force myself to get out there and maybe make friends or a gf, but i can t force myself to enjoy being around them. i d be constantly stressed out, tense, unable to relax. i d have nothing in common with them, i only ever feel comfortable alone. living with a brain like this is like torture, craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation. i m technically an adult but i have no independence, i still feel like a child, and i know for a fact that if i keep on going my future is nothing but boring, bleak and lonely. what s the point of going to an awful, stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad. my hobbies are just escapism, i don t even enjoy anything anymore, i m just so tired, i really don t see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone. i m barely in my 20s but i m certain i won t make it to 30, it s so crazy how fucked up i am, avpd is so awful, it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it. a longing hunger that can never be sated, the empty void inside my only gets bigger, things are only getting worse. no heartbreak or feeling of loss, nothing to even look back on, there s just nothing. there has always been nothing, my life is empty and always will be
i think i have avpd avoidant personality disorder i have recently come across avpd and i realized that i relate to almost all of the symptoms. first off, i m very anxious in almost all social situations. this includes hanging around friends i ve known for many many years, being around extended family who i ve also known for many years , being around coworkers, meeting new people, and even just going grocery shopping. i often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. i m not very close with my friends or family anymore. i still hangout with them sometimes but it s not on a very deep level. i don t really open myself up to anyone. i m scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they won t like me for who i am. i hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. i m close enough with my parents that i don t get anxious around them, however i still hide many pieces of myself and don t feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. i have also struggled to find jobs that don t make me anxious. it took me until i was 18 years old until i finally got my first job because of this. i currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. i have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. whenever i m at work, i feel inferior to everyone else. i feel like i have less experience, i overthink everything, and i am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. i feel like i m incompetent and people don t take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. my mind often goes blank when i m asked questions and i don t feel like i m much of a help. i also try to focus completely on the kids and i would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. i try to keep conversations polite and small. i rarely talk about myself either, just enough to get by. i play it safe. i ve always just felt like there was something wrong with me. social anxiety kinda describes the way i feel but it seems like it s more than just that.
contemplating so i've noticed that when i contemplate my inevitable death, i feel strange. i can think about if i die tomorrow, the next day, or amy other time, but when i remind myself that it is virtually impossible for me to live past say 120ish, it feels different. i think about how nothing i do will ever prevent me from dying, and really, it is the only time i feel so...human. i feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing i ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity. a hundred years after i die, what should i care? i'd be dead, so whatever i do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far. besides, by that point whatever hopes i had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me. what i'm getting at is, i'm nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me. it feels very human to me, that feeling of nigh nothingness. that is why i'd consider myself religious, because it's the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about, and that the things that i do will matter for the rest of eternity. i know it sounds crazy, and people have told me repeatedly that i'm stupid for believing in anything, but what else do i have? i've gotten as close to the edge as i could before, just to see if i would do it. clearly i didn't, but if i didn't have some hope that my faith is worth it, well, you know. anyways, what i'm getting at is that i'm religious because it makes me feel wanted, like i have a purpose, even if it's not entirely clear to me or anyone else really. i hope y'all have good coping mechanisms too, because i can take a good guess at what my life would look like if i didn't have my faith. and for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someone's religion, i'm truly sorry that you had to go through that. nobody should have to experience that. and i hope you don't think any less of me for my faith, i wouldn't try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me, and i don't get to choose how you live your life. at the end of the day, i do sincerely hope y'all are doing okay.
jesus taught avoidance i'm certain i'd be diagnosed with this disorder, and many prophets would too. john the baptist, for example, lived in the wilderness until he started his ministry. now that is dedication! there are many verses related to avpd in the bible, i'll post some at the bottom. i avoid everyone but jesus, because he is infinitely loving and wise, and talking to other people is torture in comparison. i've experienced this phenomenon in my life many times, and i see it constantly across every facet of life friend groups, businesses, etc if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. mark 3 24 it seems that we have realized no matter who or what we come into contact with, it's only a matter of time until it falls apart. i would argue this is not a disorder, but wisdom. in fact, i would encourage everyone to lean into this! whatever can be shaken, let it fall. jesus christ is the only solid foundation. he is the only thing valuable enough to unite around. without christ, it will fall apart your new social circle, workout plan, job, hobby... don't settle for second best. don't put your faith in a priest, pastor, friend, partner, family... go straight to the source! he's waiting for you to call out. you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. jeremiah 29 13 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you. for everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. matthew 7 7 8 avpd do not love the world or anything in the world. if anyone loves the world, love for the father is not in them. 1 john 2 15 you adulterous people, don t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against god? therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god. james 4 4 if you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. as it is, you do not belong to the world, but i have chosen you out of the world. that is why the world hates you. john 15 19 and before someone brings up eternal hell, visit r christianuniversalism not all christians believe eternal hell is biblical
i can t sustain long conversations it doesn t matter who the other person is, if we are engaged in a conversation, the longer it takes the more symptoms i get. at first i am ok, then the worry begins in my head where at the same time i am talking, i start observing myself. the conversation continues but at this time the symptoms i have been worried about begin to appear, my ears turn red, my lips start to shake, my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time i start observing that the person i am talking to has now noticed that i am having a reaction. my voice start to tremble as i must make some type of escape. shame overtakes me as i now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. i abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person, this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. later on as days pass, i start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. after sometime, i start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. if it is a place of employment, over time i will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so i quit so i can start fresh somewhere else but i already know what the outcome will be at each new place. i am 56 and have been like that since high school. some medications have helped, particularly effexor. also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously, but many times i forget to do the work and i get the episodes. this is all from times in my childhood where i was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts, uncles, grandparents and teachers. one of my grandma s used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when i did something bad. so for some reason now, when i talk to other adults, it triggers all of the reactions i had as a child when i was getting yelled at.
update to 'oh god, i have a date' my old post https www.reddit.com r avpd comments zwc806 oh god i have a date hi everyone! since you all were so kind i wanted to share my experience. the date went okay, but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards, shorter answers, not really engaging in text chats. it felt like she had no interest so i stopped texting her. last wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. i chatted with her and some other people. it was quite nice. afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking. she talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it, therapy and so on. she was quite open and frank. later when i was at home i thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. my picture of her had changed a bit. previously i would have said she was quite the confident woman i still think she is though , but afterwards i saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities. so, i today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee. she texted me back, that she thinks i'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me, but her life is too full right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. she'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. she is sorry, that's probably not the answer i was hoping for, but she is just trying to being honest. i wrote back, that it wasn't the answer i hoped for, but i thought i would get. i thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome, so i had to write her. so, that's it. i'm a bit sad now, although i knew this would be coming. still it's better to be in the clear. i've given up some hope to find a partner. it's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated, live through the frustration and get out of it on top. my few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life, where i was truly happy. a condition that feels unreachable at the moment. this makes it feel impossible to find love. i try to be the best person i can be, but it never feels enough.
my friend bpd really exhausts me. i dont think i even wanna be their friend anymore im sick of always being wrong no matter what i do and am expected to know what i did wrong. im tired of constant arguments and always feeling like a shitty human being in the end when i dont even know what i did. im just sick of being misunderstood and never given a chance to explain, and my friend knows im avoidant but doesnt seem to fucking care how i feel anymore things were great at first. happy fun friendship lalala and then they became really clingy and wanted to be my favorite. i felt happy at first at the idea because wowww someone really likes me that much?!?!!!! then they would always wanna be better than my friends, call, and shower me with compliments. it was sweet and flattering at first.. then, we got into some confusing relationship thing. they never clearly defined what it even was. i was too afraid to back out. it got overwhelming. and eventually i found myself distancing away. i was really confused about it all. they explained things terribly. i never knew what exactly they wanted, it was never clear. what i did wrong, what we were, their intentions, anything. they seemed to expect me to know it all but fucking hell i really dont i cant read into things so easily. maybe im flat out stupid i told them about avpd and such and they understood and were really nice and understanding at first. then, more arguments, accusations, guilt tripping. i get it i was also a shithead in this situation i think the guilt tripping, manipulation, expectations, them acting like a victim, im really drained. ive apologized over and over and cried often and its fucked me up i know im not perfect but i try my best to be kind and always have good intentions and i tell them that and oh my god they dont get it at all theyre a genuinely nice person and i know that. im just so tired of the anger, i cant take it no offense to those who have bpd. this person in particular has no self awareness or anything. and i guess they totally just blew off my avpd and just shit on me and it really hurts
thanks for being the community i never dreamt to have so yesterday i had a therapy session, and the therapist asked why i think i have no friends. i answered i have interests that few share, where i live as i live in a small city, so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also, i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live i told him i am part of many online communities, but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in these communities even if they are based on my interests at that moment i remembered reddit and this community, and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without fear when i joined reddit it was for something tech related, then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub, and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidant i was new to reddit and navigating it, but i was happy as i found people like me. as i kept browsing, i started to get related more and more to your posts. i felt a connection to you, and i realized i am not alone anymore. knowing i am not alone anymore, is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for, it meant i have people who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through. people who can understand me and i can understand them. people with who i can share whatever i want, knowing they will understand me and won't judge me in this community,i don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with you from sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advice here, i share my problems and secrets that no one knows, including my family. i finally found a home here and family this community really seems like an oasis in the desert i have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible. i feel blessed that i found you and being part of this community i just wish i could meet you or some of you in the real world and to newcomers welcome abroad. in one way or another, you aren't alone anymore.
i get very down when people don't include me socially, but but, i don't even wanna get to know them at all? it's like, i'll get sad and feel like no one wants to be around me and i'm excluded a lot. i'm never the first choice. but if i actually get it my way and get included and someone try to befriend me, i suddenly lose interest and change my mind. it's very annoying. i know i actually don't wanna befriend anyone right now, but i get sad when i'm excluded or not chosen regardless. i wish i could be more careless. i know why this is tho. because if they actually show interest in befriending me and they find me pleasant to be around i will get kinda overexcited and will be with them at all times, and sometimes that scares people away. it's either i avoid people like the plague or i get too attached. both is equally as bad tbh. but, i can't help but feel sad when i see people get along so well so easily and so fast, while i'm sitting by myself. there's times i starve, not on purpose, but because i don't wanna sit in the cafeteria at school. where do i even sit. this week i've only eaten two pizza slices and some candy, also drank some chocolate milk. i just don't wanna be around anyone. i managed to grab some dinner from the cafeteria earlier tho i live on campus . i have two years left of my time at school and i'm trying to just force myself through it all. i know i won't get better and i can't try as much as i would like, but i know i'll go back to being avoidant the second something goes wrong. i can be the most friendliest person you've ever met and be lively and bubbly, but the very second someone shows the most minuscule sign they don't enjoy being around me, i start to go into avoidant mode. i'll lock myself up in my room and go offline from all social medias, play games all day, appetite depletes and all that stuff. it can last for months. well anyways, that was just a little rant if you will. i don't have anyone to talk to obviously and thought maybe someone here would understand and relate. at least it helps a little
hi hi, i'll start by saying i've been diagnosed with avpd about 2 years ago, around the end of my military service, but it's something i've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. i'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps, mainly mentally, not physically yet as i'm not doing much, spending all my days at home, no friends no social life no nothing. i did get a job last week which i'm starting next week, 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house. but as the time goes i find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff i'd like to do like traveling the world and studying, i even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. since then i'm daydreaming about traveling, going to south america or something.. last week i said screw it and booked a ticket to barcelona, for a trip with my mom and sister. i was very excited as i'm a big fc barcelona fan for years, but as we all know, something has to go wrong. we're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days i had in the last couple of years. i feel like i just wanna disappear until friday arrives when the trip is over. i feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish, and not something i ever wanted to do. it took me some time cause i usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister, and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. i also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how i don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before i got this poor job, i was sending cv's and when people would call me i couldn't pick up the phone. i told her that i feel lonely even when i'm with them my family , cause while they do make me feel good, they can't cover up for my non existent social life. seriously i feel like a mess, i roam around feeling down like i've never felt before i think. just want to vent a little
it seems hopeless, but is there any way to find a remote job online if i have avpd and don't really have... any redeeming qualities or skills for the market due to lifelong isolation and self sabotage? i know that people who have their psyche together have an extremely hard time finding jobs too, we live in very confusing times. and i'm less employable than most people of my age. i don't have a finished degree, i don't have presentable look, i don't really have hobbies other than videogames and some niche knowledge about obscure culture things, i'm not great at communicating, but more importantly i haven't worked or studied in about 4 years at this point, so i pretty much forgot how to look and present human at this point. i'm not really interested in anything in the normal sense either due to anhedonia or general dissociation from my own emotions and needs. i'm thinking about therapy as something that could guide me and help me in life, i know this is really all eggs in one basket kind of thing, but i genuinely only believe in one thing and it's therapy. and to pay for any therapy, i need money. but i'm so lost and hopeless in navigating job market, i'm practically terrified because i'm a grown ass person and i have never worked in my life before other than one small online gig i got by pure luck, and it was a one time thing, and it's not repeatable, and skills for that don't transfer anywhere. i've heard about things like rev or something like that, but they banned my country because of recent world events. i was researching different sort of freelance stuff but i consistently got terrified of having to promote myself or even commit to any craft at all due to self defeating attitude my whole life. so in the end i don't know anything, don't have any skills other than fluent english and my native language, have absolutely no experience of any job whatsoever. it feels incredibly hopeless. any tips? maybe some websites that could help with making small money for manageable tasks? i'll be very grateful for any response.
what should i do? sorry for my bad english, but i've been bottling up for too long, and i don't know what to do, no one can understand me even my parents and therapists and strangers on the internet. last year 2022 , in february, i quit college online cuz i can't handle it, even though i got a good grade in one of my courses but i didn't think i got it at all! and after that, i wanted to start the business but i don't have money, my mom gave me money but she just gave me 16 , she said after the items sold out, i will give u money again . but when i started to sell in my shop, it didn't succeed cuz maybe i just have little items. also, when i was in college, my mom rarely gave me money, unless it was for college tuition and the money for internet. my father is still alive but he never paid for my school. but the hurt thing in my life was my stepbrothers think that my father never gave them money cuz they think that all of my father's money was used up for me. and now i am 22y.o. i sent many job applications about 20 or more , but just get accepted for 1 job, but i ignore it cuz i can't ride a motorcycle and i think the salary was too low. i was thinking that i want to go to another country for a job, so i can get better life cuz i have a chronic illness and mental illness, but i don't have money. i told my mom about that, but she didn't agree with me, she want me to just stay here. i rarely lied to my parents when i was asking for money but now, sometimes i am lying to them cuz i think they are too stingy for just the only child in this family. i wanted to try short courses to get a remote job but i am unmotivated. people on the internet was saying that i have a sexy body when i sent my pics to them. i was thinking that maybe i can get a job in onlyfans but i was too shy about that. i've never doin' voice calling and video calling when i was doin' sexting. btw, i am still a virgin but sometimes i want to try to lose it, but now there is no way to lose it cuz i have no life and my life is messed up.
must bargain with the universe for social plans so my 18ftm coworker evilyn 19f was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away, she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride, i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on sc. she mentioned having extra tickets, but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me, and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15 each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets? it's not unreasonable i know if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100 platonic because we're coworkers and i think she knows i'm gay the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls . but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. another fear evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with jonah 20m our other coworker, a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake, let's not. as in, they've hung out outside of work more than once. now, i don't think jonah is the petty type, but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. rambling post, but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone. mainly in my own head i have to earn outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket. yeeeah it's a lot. thanks for reading all
the root cause of my avpd i have spent a lot of time thinking about how i ended up with this disorder. constantly reviewing and analyzing my past memories, trying to find and pinpoint the exact event that caused me to be this way. i wasn't sure i had one, and i still think it may be multiple events in my life that led to the development of this disorder. but for me, i think the formation of my avpd has always been interlinked with my sexuality. i am gay and hispanic. growing up in a mexican household, parents are not accepting of that whatsoever. anyways, i remember i still remember this time where i was looking up basically dick pics and i didn't delete the search history. i was 13 at the time and was barely discovering porn. my mom checked it before any of us got home and while she was at work later she called my dad and told him about what she found. my dad told me that she was crying because she couldn't accept that her son might be gay. i explained it away to my dad that i was just checking to see how i sized up to other boys my age. but i sorta knew what i was doing. i guess that moment was pretty scary to me. knowing not even my own parents would accept me. and so i hid myself, for a long time. pretending to be straight year after year. it just got harder every year to put on the mask. and still now at the age of 24 i have never told anyone in my personal life that i'm gay. not like they don't know it or highly suspect it, even though i present myself more masculine. i've never had a girlfriend so i think it's pretty obvious to everyone. but anyways i think it was very much so having to do with moments like i first mentioned. where i was scared and felt completely alone. i guess it would have changed everything to have someone to tell me it's ok and that there's nothing wrong with me and that i'm loved just the same. but i didn't get that. i just learned from an early age that i was different and so i would be treated differently, unless i hid it.
this shit sucks can t even freely express yourself and connect with people being ugly has made me feel like a fucking robot. i m sooo fucking jealous of everyone everywhere. everyone at my job has these personalities that they just express without thinking of how the other person will perceive them. they crack lame jokes witty jokes and everyone laughs and accepts it and they all act like they re brothers and sisters. of course i m the fucking outcast who is quiet all the time and doesn t say anything but robotic one liners . because i feek like thats all i can do. anytime i ve tried being funny and more comfortable i got shot down so many times. people would say who tf says that shut up or just flat out ignore me opposed to how they laugh with each other and and add on to each other s jokes i feel like i have to constantly watch what i say every fucking time i m talking to anyone. people have said kobes weird hes too quiet hes a loner but like i m only quiet cause i feel like people will consider me lame and annoying if i try expressing myself and talking to them it s not fair no one else has these fears and i m essentially trapped in my brain locked out from making any meaningful connections the worst part is i don t even think this is fixable. it s been this way for basically my whole life. like whenever i tried to take a leap and express myself i ve mostly been shot down and looked at like i was special needs and it s dehumanizing and isolating i don t know what tf to do. i m so sick of being cursed to ugliness and this sub i just want to live my fucking life and connect with people i feel like when youre ugly you re not allowed to really express yourself and joke like everyone else because people will automatically take offense to it so unfortunately even tho i want to connect with people i stay to myself cause i feel like i m unbearably boring and awkward and like people don t like me and would rather not talk to me soo fuck
what to say to those who you ghosted and what they might say i know some people are happy to cut ties with people, but others feel guilty or anxious about cutting ties and freeze because too much time has passed. if someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things, that would be so helpful even if much time has passed. the people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused, and the truth is they probably internalized it as something they have said or done wrong. if they did not do anything wrong, that is something to highlight. hi. i just wanted you to know that i have been struggling with some personal things, and that's why i haven't reached out. i am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet. but i do want to let you know i care. i'm sorry if i have left you hurt and confused. it was not something you have done wrong. i am not in a place to explain further, but i do hope you are well. some people may be understanding, and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all, or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and don't want to risk that again. rejection hurts people without mental illness, too! that is not necessarily a rejection of you, but more of a reflection of the place where they're at mentally. it may have taken them a while to move on from the relationship friendship. some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again. in my opinion, that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to, you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make. one way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted unless you let them know you ghost at times .
my brain just goes blank even if i want to engage i don't know if this is an avpd thing or not, but does anybody else here mostly don't speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank? i frequently find myself at conversations most of them tbh where i want to talk and engage but i just don't know what to respond at all. i catch myself saying a lot of mmm , yeah , it's true , i agree but not something... substancial, you know? sometimes i even repeat words just to use more time like yeah, yeah . meanwhile, when i observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say, some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going, and it seems so natural for them. i always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than i can, and honestly i think this has been proven true over time. some time ago i created a personal system to help me fill up silences and some of the things i set myself to do at these moments where 1. just think out loud without filtering so much i read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes think with their mouths while introverts think first, then decide if it's worth sharing and for us with avpd and or sad we mostly decide it is not and 2. look for a subject connection, even if it's minimal, then be like this reminds me of... and keep going about it . when i observe other people interacting i can see them using these a lot naturally i feel like a robot because i had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice but even with this system, i'm still having problems because, like i said, a lot of times i simply can't think of anything. i don't know if this is some kind of freeze response to the danger of socialization or if my brain is just socially dumb lol.
am i a piece of shit or what? i mean, i've never been diagnosed cause i'm afraid of going to the psychiatrist and discovering i'm a real shit, but this days i was doing a personality check from twitter just for the joke, and the result avpd came so close home i felt offended. i grew up always walking behind my group of friends. i could never do anything apart from others. in any social situation it has always been my role to be the child in the corner or the one following the parents. it doesn't help my father is a controlling sexist. i've never slept out my own house, never dated someone openly afraid he would beat me up , never visited my friends houses i don't even know if i can call them friends . i'm nerdy but not smart. i always got high grades in school, but i never liked being complimented on it because i thought most of my grades came from the cheating sheets i made to remember the subjects before the exams. if i have to talk with someone for anything, i have a script in my head i have to follow to ensure i'm not saying anything idiot. after graduating from school, i fell for my relative's advice and did not leave my hometown, preferring to go to college in the neighboring city and work with that relative. well, we had a fight and i had to quit uni cuz i was fired. i couldn't muster up the strength to deliver resumes in my city due to sheer shyness. five years have passed since then. i'm almost 23 years old. i'm just a high school graduate. no professional course taken, no money in hand, living with my parents...i still don't want to hand out resumes, i don't want to get in touch with people... i long for physical contact, but i don't have the courage to get close to anyone... so, to you guys who suffer from avpd, how do you cope with this shit? how do you guys have strength to work? sorry, my thoughts were all over the place while i was writing, so please forgive me if it sounds confusing.
rock. bottom. i'm at rock bottom right now. i'm about to lose my job my next work day most likely and be jobless. family is so disappointed in me. everyday i'm in survival mode at work. avoidance had bleeded into my job and i can't help it. the anxiety is too crippling and it makes me do all sorts of weird awkward shit at my job. my chronic isolation outside of work also seemingly killed my social skills so i feel numb to all interactions. i sense a mental breakdown is about to erupt and i'm likely to walk away the job but i'd rather get high and lose my job over marijuana then quitting. either way, i'm doomed. i have a bad reputation in my job at this point, my real self is being exposed coworkers for sure shame gossiping me. my coworkers all have strong connections with each other now and i'm still that one insecure, awkward shy guy. so ashamed. worked my warehouse job over a year and half now. idk how i made it this far but my behaviorial symptoms have caught up to me. literally avoiding everything at work and everybody. hide in bathroom during breaktimes. avpd and depression worst combo. consequently, i didn't save enough money while working this warehouse job not only for myself but for the sake of my immediate family as well so everything about to come crashing on me. addictions make saving money hard even at the sake of supporting family . i let myself down and my family. sighhh. what a crippling hell of a condition avpd depression is. no excuses. i can't even leave my house. i can see myself being homeless potentially in the near future. everything that involves making a decision i literally just can't do and that includes getting help. ik this was a lot y'all just wanted to vent . your not alone if reading this keep your head high i don't mean to bring u guys down . if you're making progress i'm proud of you and that means a lot for me and the rest of avpd sufferers. thanks for reading!
boyfriend broke up with me over my avpd i was already thinking about breaking up with him just because avpd made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didn t necessarily do anything wrong, but it s still gut wrenching. i m not necessarily heartbroken, i just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to i get you have avpd and you can t help it, but it s your fault this isn t working out . he was sick of me constantly ghosting him, never directly communicating or confronting him about anything, and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult. i already feel guilty enough about the way avpd makes me act without someone i thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways i ruined this for him, all of which just so happen to be things i already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. in situations like this, people usually say some shit like it s not you it s me or go easy on you, right? not to mention, one of his reasons was that i was ghosting him while i have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so i genuinely didn t have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond, which feels like maybe he should ve been a tiny bit more understanding of, but in terms of the big picture, i guess i understand. it still feels like shit though. i ve never been broken up with before, and even though i wanted out since the week he first confessed to me, i don t know if i ll be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know i was the bad boyfriend and everything i was insecure about, i have every right to hate myself for. edit after i panic blocked him on all social media, he is now anonymously harassing me on tumblr to confront me about it and generally being very childish and kinda fucked up and creepy, so. maybe i dodged a bullet, actually.
anyone here feel incapable of love? never been diagnosed with avpd as i am too scared of asking my therapist what he thinks since by his writing he doesn't seem to care much about pd labels and i'm too afraid i will look like one of those people who tries to be cute quirky unique special by hunting for diagnoses. but i resonate a lot with the stories and thoughts feelings i have read from people who have avpd and a lot of it sounds like things i have said thought felt almost word for word. i'm curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if i'm being over dramatic. i won't go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why i'm a loser, but i basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom it's your fault for being upset and an explosively angry father taught me it was never ok to say no . since both of them worked all day i was pretty much raised by my older half sister who had issues of her own obviously and she would constantly bully and belittle me. my half brother essentially ignored me when i was growing up. i was also constantly bullied in elementary middle school for being weird and shy, and had to see therapists that i didn't want to talk to when i was as young as 6 7 years old. i'm 26 years old and have never dated kissed had sex with anyone and have never made any attempt to do so. i don't have any friends except on the internet . i used to think a partner and friends were things i wanted but thinking about it now, i feel like either as a result of my upbringing or maybe some other brain failure, i'm really not capable of loving anyone. i'm not even sure if i love any members of my family. i can also never be 100 comfortable in a room with someone else no matter how long i have known them for because anything that would involve me being me i would need to be alone for. anyone relate or am i just a sociopath?
being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. i really enjoy watching people live their lives, listening indirectly to their conversations while in public, being an observer of events etc. my problem is having to interfere on the world, i hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. i wish i could just watch life like a tv show or as if i was a ghost, in a way that no one could see me, nothing would be expected of me and i wouldn't need to worry because i would be certain of it. i could just contemplate the world in peace. some of you guys may have watched euphoria and i definitely feel a connection with the description made about lexi, how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life, just some sort of play or movie. these days i been having the classic i want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams, and i guess that a big part of it is because i feel like there i could be like this, or at least similar enough. be an observer of nature, never having to deal with socialization again, only brief interactions for, let's say, buy necessary stuff from other people which i don't mind . i know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing, but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction. i guess i'm just burned out of people. a lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and i'm really bitter about it right now. of course i want to find real connection, where i could be myself openly and comfortably, but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments i'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. i don't have patience for people anymore, i'm tired, i'm being judgy as hell and i'm activelly avoiding new people.
root of avpd and life damaging thoughts i had m21. my problem with avpd is that it made me weak, defenseless, i feel like prey living among predators. my self esteem is low and i know how it can be increased, it just requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear. i was bullied by two different group of people, i realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness, the second time i was bullied by my friends at that time , initially they even respected me cause i was serious, but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and i even can see their perspective, you just need to be more tough and confident without any reason . this experience reflected in my thoughts i was living with till recently when i was a kid i thought you need to really know how to dance, know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it, cause how they being so stupid could think about it really, it's not possible, but they fuck, i don't. second was about clothes, hypebeasts. i thought classmates were making fun of me cause i looked weird, lame. even though it's not fully wrong i just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. there wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes, i just couldn't understand their reaction. third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that i missed, or like there was some hidden context i was unaware of. it was a constant thought when i was with my peers. i also has such problem that i often can't decide when i should feel offended and when not, it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. this is also a beginning of my ppd part of personality. this kind of thinking leads to paranoia. i hope i won't regret posting this. maybe it's the only time i can be honest.
this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. was scrolling on tiktok when i saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my fyp. she's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. she now just recently joined an f1 school. i know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things, but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. i just realized that i'm 2 years older than her and i'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons , and i still don't even know wtf i wanna do in life. my best friend is so fckin smart, she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. my other best friend is also smart, all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country . i'm surrounded by smart, and talented people with a future, people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. people who have already carved their paths. while i'm here barely even making it through the day. i can't even go to school without wanting to off myself, while they're here working their ass off for their future. my best friends don't even know i already dropped out of high school. i'm too embarrassed to tell them. how can i tell them? they would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. what am i even doing with my life? i always avoid things, things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. now look where that got me. stuck inside the house wasting my life away. i'm gonna be 20 in october, my teen years are finally over. i didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. i can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.
seeing some progress but feeling stuck. hi, 24 year old male with avpd here. for some time i have noticed that contacts with other people in my case only at work began to bring me pleasure. i've also become more relaxed and when i'm around people i don't worry as much about how they react to what i say. at the same time, a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. this desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. i just want, as real as never before in my life, a simple conversation with another person and intimacy. however, i don't know how to achieve this. i've finished my education and i don't have any social hobbies the gym can be considered as such, but i still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there . i'm starting to get annoyed with this situation, because certainly something has changed in my attiude and i truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. i think i'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step, but i don't know how to do it. one way to do it is to start dating. finding a partner is something that i want very strongly and i think love is something i'm capable of. the thing that's holding me back from making that move though other than, well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps is knowing that i'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. i am not sure have any of you reached such a point on your journey to normality ? i'm not sure if i'm over analyzing everything and if i shouldn't just do what i feel regardless of my doubts. in my case, finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and i don't know how i could achieve it. however, i will be grateful for every piece od advice!
who is my first love? have i fallen in love yet? as someone with avpd, i have trouble connecting with people. i know i'm smart, and attractive, and i care for people, but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. i've had two guys like me back in the past few years. which one of them would be considered my first love ? the first guy dave i met when i was 19 on vacation. he and i would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy, he has a nerdy side . we only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. but our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. he cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. we don't even talk, so i don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. the second guy steve i met a year later, at my job. he and i bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and i told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives . we worked together for a little over a year. and we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. but stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. but a customer asked me for my number one day, and i gave it to him. i guess i kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out, but literally the week after, he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up , but they broke up and he likes me. view poll https www.reddit.com poll 11wpn90
going at your own pace i believe some days ago there was a post about being tired of importance of communication skills in life. now, there's kinda similar issue but with the pace that everything's is going with. just my personal experience, i am not speaking for everyone. so, last year i quit college cus i couldn't bear stress and deadlines. i was pretty slow to understand and do things that was required, professors or whatever they're called, sry not sure were pressuring us a lot with all that and so on. i have a job as a stocker now but in about month or so i have to think about other options for studying colleges universities, just some other field , and that honestly makes my stomach twist. it's not about what i want, it's about how it'll all go. i'd love to spend my time studying art but i am so afraid of the process. when i think about it, i can imagine only flaws and mistakes i'd make. there would be so much things to learn and practice but so little time to do all that. and now to the title. i hate that everything must be spinning crazy like that. if you want to study, you must be catching up quickly, otherwise it's immediately your one big ass problem and no one is willing to help you with that. it'd so damn cool if there was any way to get education on your own pace, so you have enough time for everything. i know it's only in my dreams but i can't stop thinking about it. i am so slow because my brain is so fried after all these years fighting this plague. i don't know, maybe it's just me and i am that broken but it's really so sad that i can't normally go towards my dreams. and those fears aren't even irrational, same shit happened year ago and i know myself so damn well it couldn't be any way around. sorry for such long bullshit vent, i had to get it off my chest
i just realised i don't seem to make friends soooo...i'm 44 years old. i have a group of about 15 friends in my home town in another state to where i live , but 14 of them i did not make. all of those 14 were made by my best friend back in school who i befriended at age 14 , who is quite outgoing. and then we just had this friendship group which started at 4 and then eventually grew, and i count them all as my friends, but i never actually made any of them myself. i made not a single friend in university. i made 2 friends at my first job when i was 22, but we never saw each other outside the workplace and i haven't heard from them in 20 years, since i left there. i made 2 friends at a subsequent workplace when i was about 30, but one kind of kept trying to be my friend so insistently that eventually i gave in, and she was fun and nice, but i haven't seen her for over 10 years. the other one i realised later was my favourite person fp bpd lingo , and that is the only reason i was interested enough to want to get to know her and want her to get to know me. i had a platonic crush on her. even so, after 2 years, my interest fizzled and i haven't heard from her since, also about 10 years ago. then, when i was 40, i made a friend here in my building she lives in my home town most of the year but has a place here too , and she became my favourite person, which again, is why i let her in and we became close. again, my feelings of attraction fizzled after about 2 years and we're still friends, but i hardly see her as she doesn't live here most of the time. so, i feel like my friends are all mainly made via my original friend, who i made at age 14. and now, 30 years later...i still don't really have any friends and haven't really made any. is that weird?
i moved out. a friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and i told him about how i wanted to put distance between me and them. he said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out. i've been in a new place now for five days. i have a roommate, he is cool. his work keeps me from seeing him very much, so i only have to deal with other people in small doses. the best thing is that i'm finally away from my relatives! it always feels weird when i say i miss you too over the phone because i don't miss them at all. i'm so happy to finally be freed of them! people do keep telling me that it's natural for me to feel this way and that i'll miss them eventually, but i don't want to miss them. i had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff, but i dreaded seeing anyone there. i left as soon as i could, and i guess i just don't know how to feel now. i still love them, i never didn't love my relatives, but i know they're not good for me. i am much better on my own. i guess i just feel guilty, like i owe them something. part of me wants to go back and try to fix them, but i have to keep reminding myself that i can't do that, and that they're not my responsibility. so, i'm determined to not go back for as long as possible. the only reason i'd go back now is to get my bike, but i can be without that for a while. otherwise, i'm done belonging to them. i am my own person now, and i'm slowly getting to like who i'm becoming. i definitely still have many times where i hate myself for messing something up or blaming myself for something that can't be helped or just wasn't my fault. but overall, things are getting better, and me leaving my relatives behind is just one of many steps in the right direction.
lack of opinion and interest in things anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? new show comes out, new game comes out, new trend, im always late to it all. i always find myself saying the phrase that s a thing? when people bring up things i genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else has i seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. if 0 is i hate it and 10 is i love this and will skip sleep to do it , the highest i can get is like a 7. even with the things i love . which sucks. because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. and often times i m just not that into it as the people around me. one simple example is when i tried playing dnd. it just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and i wanted to be as well, but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. and i get that it might not be my cup of tea, but like, this happens with everything i try or when i was considering my major for school. i ended up picking something that i had just heard was a highly paid major, without really thinking about it at all. i didn't bother to look into what classes i would be taking, what jobs it would train me for, hell, whether or not i even liked it. it was just ok, sounds good . one of the most important decisions of my life, made in 10 minutes. and now senior year, i'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career. makes me think about how many opportunities i ve missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. idk i'm asking on this sub mostly because i'm curious if this is related to avpd or not. or if it s more a personality thing
i hate school i am currently in my second semester in college and i hate it. i am not the most intelligent person but i try my best. it's expensive but my scholarships cover it so i am going for free. i am very grateful that i have this opportunity but it is terrible. i started with a mandatory orientation where all we did was walk around and talk to each other. this was my personal circle of hell. i can manage in small groups, but this was at least 30 people. a week of that. amp x200b i also had a class called you at school . it was all team building. it was a show up for credit class and i almost failed because i wouldn't participate. i had to do a presentation and just started crying in the middle of it. i have never been more embarrassed in my life. i went to sit down and the girl next to me was patting my shoulder and asking if i wanted to go into the hallway for a bit. i don't like people touching me. amp x200b now, as a recovering addict, i have another layer of isolation. everyone is in their my mom is not here let's party phase and i can't be around any type of substance without jeopardizing my sobriety. so i can't just show up to an open party or talk because that's all people do now. amp x200b i also have a class that's just discussion groups. it is 12 people so not as bad as my larger class', except no one talks. it's just the t a repeating the same question prompt over and over till someone speaks up. i wanted to fill the awkward silence so i said something and now i am expected to talk all the time. amp x200b i hate talking. i wish i had an invisibility cloak to go to class with. i am ruining my education because i can't function properly. and i am so jealous of others around me. i want to be happy like them.
how to not hurt peoples feelings i think i m doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day i get so worn out from all the effort it takes that i need a recovery day where i literally don t interact with anyone or else i start shutting down. however society does not work on my schedule and so obviously i can t always have a recovery. when i m socially overwhelmed i tend to give short answers and seem super aloof, disinterested, monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them, i m just worn out. usually with strangers it doesn t matter that much because i ll never meet them again, but with my friends or partner it can be hard. they obviously care about me and start asking, are you mad at me? am i annoying? etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying, but i m just really irritated right now for reasons other than you, and you are exacerbating it. but it is not your fault and there s no reason you would ve known this like i wish i could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. i can t manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because i at least want to preserve their feelings. my partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me, do you hate me, am i annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent it s a reflection of real insecurities i know she has told me about. i can t handle navigating those questions when i m socially overstimulated but i don t want to make her insecure worse either. i know a relationship is a two way street but i always feel like a burden for my emotions and needs any advice?
how common is this for people with avpd? sorry, i'll try to keep it relatively short. i'm a 31 year old male and i've never been diagnosed with avpd, but while reading about the symptoms a month ago, things finally made sense to me why i act a certain way. i thought i just had some kind of social anxiety when i went to therapy several years ago, but i've felt that there has to be something else since i started feeling different in middle school. i've avoided people, responsibilites and have taken jobs where i can mostly avoid interpersonal communication. i do still have close friends, a great family and a girlfriend, but i still have this urge to self isolate and be alone. however, i do try to help people whenever asked and i try to do well at my workplace. right now, i have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 1 3 years along the line in a position that i could basically hold for the rest of my working life. but it would surely involve a lot more responsibilites, speaking another language i don't know too well i live in a bilingual country, where i speak the minority language a lot more and of course, a ton more interpersonal communication. i've searched and applied for other jobs recently because my current contract will expire in a few months. i'm much more inclined to take a temp job for 1 and a half year with something i like more and less interpersonal communication than a potential permanent job position. it probably sounds crazy for most people if they heard this, but this is genuinely how i feel. i let my feelings of inadequacy and wanting to avoid people control me instead of doing something that could secure my future. is this at all relatable?
don't be like me little rant i was a college freshman at the beginning of covid. i was just your stereotypical introverted quiet guy who also struggled in social situations. covid gave me the perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful. don't have to go to class, don't have to meet anybody, everyday i just drowned myself in entertainment. eventually i dropped out of class and basically became a shut in. fast forward to a couple years later. i have no idea how time went by so fast. everyone is all grown up and busy, people keep asking about how i'm doing at school, and everytime i lie to my parents that yeah i'm going to school, i did good on my exams, i'm about to graduate etc. it's so fucking unfair to my parents that i turned out to be such a piece of shit. i hate what i've become, just lies and avoidance. when i'm actually motivated to do something, i'm then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what i do i still wasted all these years of my adulthood, that i'm still betraying my parents' expectations, that nothing i do is going to undo all the damage i did to myself. i'm a mess. i have no hobbies i can share with normal people, i have no humor because i don't have any experience in the real world, i can't make my family happy because i don't even like myself and it shows. sorry for the rant, sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and it's unbearable. why didn't i try harder at school? why didn't i tell my parents the truth? facing all these fears, i chose the easy way. and it is clearly the wrong choice, otherwise i wouldn't be suffering this much now. if you're reading this i hope you can learn not to be like me. avoidance is hell.
having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me i am 24m and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind, not even crushes. i lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff. i've never even had female friends except some cousins. i live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. i'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious, especially for women. but i don't see myself ever getting married. i'll probably kms before 30. it feels like i will miss out on this part of the human experience because i'm so insecure around women. i saw a post that summarised how i feel perfectly gt i have trouble talking to women, in fact i can't even make eye contact with them, especially if i find them even a little attractive. i'm scared they'll think i like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them. i know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. it's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women, if they think i like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. even though i'm scared to even let myself think that i might like someone i know that i should try to make friends with women first, but i'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women let alone having female friends or a relationship . it's like i carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and i automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it. is there anyone out here who knows what this is like?
i look like how i want to. so, this is actually something really positive for me, even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. i was going to the bathroom, and i was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. the pants used to fit me just fine, but i've lost so much weight that i have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. anyways, what i'm getting at is, i saw myself in the mirror when i walked in, and i couldn't help but think that i look exactly how i want to look. i love how comfy clothes look, my hair is long and messy, and i guess i'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. i am embarrassed that as a guy, i like feeling cute, but i think it's great and i've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. but when i was admiring myself in the mirror, i lifted up my hoodie no i don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies, the temperature much too hot for that as i can barely wear this hoodie and i saw that my waist was super skinny. of course, i don't eat much, and i still function fine, so i guess that's okay. what i'm getting at is, i was able to look at myself in the mirror today, and i liked what i saw, and people can think what they want, i look exactly how i want to look today, and i love that. things have really been getting better for me, and though there's still plenty of low points, i can easily see my condition is getting better. i hope everyone else is doing okay, and i hope that by sharing this i can bring some hope to anyone else who has been struggling with this pd. thank y'all if you read this far, and i hope you're doing well.
therapy with avpd does it even work? i ve been in and out of therapy since i was 13. that s half my life. i ve seen psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and counsellors i ve been through cbt, dbt, goal focused therapy, grief therapy. i ve been on so many medications. i ve never been allowed myself to become unstable enough to be hospitalized, and i ve been able to be the bare minimum functional and composed enough to fly under the radar of more intense interventions. when it comes to therapy i have a severe problem with trusting my therapists, failing to disclose what i really need help with, struggling to express my true thoughts, worrying excessively about judgement and criticism, and leaving therapy after the initial hope of this one will be what helps dies out likely because of aforementioned problems . in march 2020 i was diagnosed with bpd but for reasons it was march 2020 i never got it addressed, but now that i have insurance that covers most of the cost of sessions, i want to try again. i m paying some out of my own pocket too and i don t know if it s even worth it due to my history with therapy i sent in a general inquiry to a private office close to me and they referred me to a male therapist, which terrifies me as i ve only had female therapists before, and who uses a different approach psychodynamic therapy , which is again fucking terrifying. i want to ghost and just not do this so badly and i m just fighting against myself, arranging two 2 emails is exhausting and fucking nerve wracking, and i don t even know if this is going to go anywhere. i don t even know if im asking for advice or just venting, but thanks for reading anyway
has tough love ever worked on any of you? my family is a very tough love type of family. as far back as i can remember, my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad ways habits through tough love , but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me, so it clearly has never worked. just as an example of what i mean, my dad would give me tough love in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if i continued to be a fat slob true . and the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that i wasn't being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning, i'm an adult and need to start acting like one, it is extremely embarrassing at this point, etc also true . but even though i know these things are true, hearing people phrase it like hard truths i'm just too dense to grasp doesn't make me want to change for the better. it makes me want to go home, put a gun in my mouth, and pull the trigger because to my family i come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit i already know. i am wondering if this type of tough love is actually helpful for anyone, especially people with avpd, because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down. it's like it really does solidify the fact that i am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me, and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years. but everyone keeps touting tough love as if it's some magic cure all that will make someone instantly snap out of whatever undesireable thing they're doing.
society has already collapsed and i don't want to be a part of it. i've isolated myself for a long time. i never fit in anyway, i couldn't make connections last. i always messed up. but i tried. i now realise that it's too late. i grew in such an abusive family that i never learned how to love and relate. and then i fell ill. since then i became disabled. sometimes my arms hurt so bad, that i can't type. i've been trying to survive a gruesome situation for months now. i can only communicate in short bursts. all the rest that i need is gone. and i put myself out there. ashamed and small. guess what? no one cares. i'm at fault too. but it's not only me. i hope it will be over soon. but i rather struggle alone. i hope that i can get some of my hobbies back, take up space. i can't chat anymore, it makes me want to barf. i can't really go outside and to be honest, i am scared. i found out how easy it is to abuse me. it's not like i can run, just hide. there's nothing much to say. i truly am alone. i am different, but i just want to be in peace with myself, with the chronic pain, with the fact that people and i don't work together. i'm not charming or young. i'm just venting into the nothingness. i isolated more and more when i got negative feedback. it's too late now. everybody struggles, i don't understand basic things. i just want the current crisis to be over. don't want to improve myself. or to function. i want to breathe and sleep without fear until shit really hits the fan and we'll all break together and apart. sometimes it feels like too much to ask. i want to believe that i matter, not because of someone else. it's not going to happen.
rejection this is kind of a stupid, petty thing to talk about but honestly, i just wanna get this off my chest. i have a friend, we've been friends for like, 5 years already and we've basically grown up together. we were both sort of socially withdrawn so all we had were one another, and so we'd talk everyday, all day. i remember this one time we had a conversation where they told me that they tend to ghost people and slowly pull back when they feel as if talking to someone starts to feel draining, or they just don't like the person anymore. lately, they've been pulling away, like replying less and less, and just ignoring me for the entire day. though, sometimes they'd stay and have a full conversation with me, but it's kind of rare and i get the feeling that they do it only to keep me there , like to ensure my stay... kind of like a push and pull. it's not like they don't have time either. sometimes when we'd have a half conversation, they'd always, and i say always, talk about how they're connecting with someone, how they had fun with someone new, all this passionate stuff, and it just stings a bit. by a bit, i mean a lot. i know i'm not entitled to their time by any means but like, i just feel like i've been hit by a truck. i know they're purposely ignoring me, i know they're losing interest in me, i even get the feeling that we're growing out of one another. i'm just wondering... what about me isn't enough that's worthy of their time? am i not interesting enough? am i boring? i don't know. oh well, shit happens i suppose. i'm trying to fight the urge to isolate myself for half a year because i keep feeling rejected by them.
avpd, adhd, anxiety, being an adult. me again having another midlife crisis? i can't function in life. i have adhd and may have a bunch of other problems so i don't know if it's related to avpd or not. i forgot to take my thyroid hormone two days straight and i also didn't buy my antidepressants for some stupid reason. when i finally went to buy them, they were out of stock. so yesterday i was super sad and vulnerable and also feeling physically drained like was going to pass out. then came the anxiety and crying. today, thanks to my mom, i bought my life numbing drugs after being scolded like a kid , and i'm having another melt down. i don't know who i am anymore. am i this mess of a person or is it the drugs? when i'm ok am i really ok? i feel so incompetent, so stupid, so weak. i can't take care of myself. my house is messy even though i try every single day to make it beautiful, i have no job and zero courage or motivation to get one , no independence. i feel so scared of everything, of being alone in the end, and dying alone. and knowing my life depends on me taking the thyroid hormones doesn't help. i need people so much but i'm terrified to reach out and be rejected. i'm afraid my husband will leave me even though he is super caring and loving. i'm afraid once people see the black hole in my chest they'll run away. i shouldn't need another human being like this since i'm in my 30s already. don't even know where i'm going with this post. i just feel like life is incredibly hard for me but only in my head. i have it easy and i'm struggling to survive and maybe it'll always be like this because of avpd....?
i have just bailed on a friend for the third weekend in a row i feel pretty bad about it, too. last weekend i had plans i didn't and the weekend before that, i actually was sort of going through something. but tonight... i just don't want to see anyone. so i cancelled again. but i am trying to make up for it, and i offered to do lunch sunday he's accepted . i'm unsure if i told him about my disorder, and honestly, i think he'd not get avpd anyways. i have had many experiences telling people about avpd and they just sort of give a well meaning, but not getting it nod. i have been diagnosed with avpd for well over a year now, and i've been in therapy for even longer, so i'm quite good at the whole mindfulness thing. so, this year has been all about self improvement for me. and i just don't feel ready to go back out into the nightlife. we go to gay bars quite frequently we are both gay . i feel like i'm in my chrysalis as i finally work on myself for the first time, like ever. going out feels like i'm forcing myself to hatch too soon and i just imagine myself as this gooey half baked butterfly if i try to go out now. i want to get to my full form to go out and about. and i'm just not there yet. but further, going out is a lot of things that could go wrong for me. where am i going to put my car? ubers are a lot of money here . what happens if i leave it at his place but i want to go home earlier than him? etc. etc. being alone in my apartment is just so peaceful. but it's lonely. and i know if i keep this up, when the loneliness becomes too much further on down the road, i might not have any friends left to see.
has anything actually worked for anyone? when i say i ve tried it all i mean it. every medication you can name except maois because i actually medically can t take them. cbt, dbt, emdr, ketamine infusions, ketamine nasal spray, tms, talk therapy, and about a million other things. it s just been getting worse and worse. now i can t even sing in the shower without the fear of my neighbors hearing me so i just don t sing. can t sing in front of my mom. and i know i can sing i sang in a band for years when i was young and now it makes me nauseous to think about. i barely leave my house. if i go to a restaurant i think everyone is staring at me and judging me and i know they aren t but my brain doesn t listen. if i m having a bad skin day acne wise then i don t leave the house even if i have shit to do. i physically cannot talk to strangers. i would give anything to not care what people think and to just be carefree. im one step away from becoming an agoraphobic and i am a musician!! it s ruining my life like my friends don t even talk to me anymore. i m ready to off myself tbh, because this shit is making my depression about a million times worse. and my autism tbh because i feel like my sensory issues have gotten wayyyy worse. and i just wanna know has anyone has success? because i have no hope left. and i need some right about now .but my therapist and psychiatrist told me there s nothing else i can do for you . edit on anxiety meds buspiron, xanax, and ativan and depression meds nortriptyline and i ve tried everything else. i also meditate every day, i have my medical weed card, and i do yoga
new here. a work related conundrum. i'm a male in my late 30s, struggling to find traction in terms of being able to support myself. recently, i've only lasted a few weeks in a couple of different environments, retail and warehouse. i could do the actual jobs well enough but i get tripped up socially, targeted by others, and quit as a consequence. i've had a difficult time throughout my adult years sustaining employment. there have been times where i had long term prospects but they ultimately ended badly. this has me in a pretty desperate mindset and i've decided to seek services for help finding something suitable. what i want, ideally, is to have a space to work as independently as possible, with low social expectations and predictable responsibilities. i've been doing some gig work off and on, which meets those requirements, but that isn't a reliable income and you burn through gas . my wife, who makes ok income, is being as patient and supportive as possible with me but we need a second income, especially with living costs skyrocketing. it's crucial that i maintain a job so that i can keep the marriage stable and avoid homelessness, which is what would likely happen if things fall apart. we don't have kids so at least that isn't an issue at stake. i should add that i'd never qualify for disability benefits given my education and work history. what have others done to be able to support themselves, long term? what accommodations, if any, have you asked for in a job? and finally, has anyone significantly improved their self image and ability to handle the bs at work? thanks for reading.
i am really, truly screwed this time my parents have decided to stop paying for my food, in the middle of a catatonic depression. i m scared for myself. i woke up today finally having had enough with starving. i was on my way to the store, for the first time in a month i ve only been running low about a week tho , when i got this text from my dad do not spend any money at all this week. rent is coming out and there is only enough in there for the payment. unfortunately, you have gone through the remainder of the borrowed money from the loans i took out. and you didn t get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. you will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account. i m backed so far into a corner. i am just defeated. i have no food left, i have no money, and i can t bear the judgement. it feels like i ve already lost everything, now they ve even taken my food? i can t do anything about it in this mental state. they don t even know i ve already failed out of my semester and can t leave my apartment. and my parents are insane. legitimately delusional and abusive human beings. i mean i m crazy, but these folks? who starves their mentally ill son because there s not enough money and then flies to vegas for the weekend for a vacation? i hate myself but even i don t deserve this. the isolation, judgement, and control i live under is unimaginable. there s nothing metaphorical about it, it is torture. edit i m doing alright, got some help from a friend for this week. looking into my options.
hey here are some thoughts of mine i believe some or all of you could relate to for your next therapy visit.. avpd in summary so i feel.. sexually compulsive i feel energy drained.. stress accumulated leading to failure stress about just anything in general.. too much of it difficult to have own opinion, i doubt if i even agree on the way that i feel or think about a certain topic at times. i believe this stems from stress depressed.. sometimes i just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times. occurs usually when i m around people, and gives me a feeling of desolation like i am emotionally alone in my own world i want to finish this with a little bit of food for thought, of what i have come to a conclusion is what doubt has done in your life and mine guys think of any moment you ve felt doubt.. remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test. now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy, that s where i strongly feel stress inhibits us and we don t even bat an eye and question it. but why question why you are stressed.. isn t this just part of who i am? i should learn to live with it.. it s so difficult to live this way, we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have, but doubt lives upstairs from us, casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity..
can't even show up for my own life and do the activities i wanna do. honestly don't know where to go from here. existence is completely wasted on me. i have group oriented activities i want to join, yet i just can't do it...i can't even risk social rejection or ridicule. i'm currently in thailand on a six week trip with my partner and child. while that sentence doesn't exactly sound like it puts me in the category of avoidant personality disorder, i am one of the most avoidant people on earth. i spent three years at university and only ever talked to about four people, none of whom i developed friendships with. i've spent my entire adult life working remotely alone at home so that i can avoid any work environment that requires socializing. even my relationship is pretty low quality we don't exactly sit down and have lengthy interesting conversations every day. but perhaps even worse still, there are various group oriented activities i'd love to try that would bring value to my life, and i can't at all bring myself to do them. one example is muay thai. i signed up for a class yesterday, arrived at the gym, and turned back at the entrance. this has happened several times. and it's a consistent theme in my adult life, whether the activity is a martial art, soccer, or a hiking meetup. basically, i can't show up for my own life and do the activities that i value. i'm not really living and never really have. i'm now 32 years old ffs, close to middle aged. i'm almost certain i'll be dead before 35...what a waste of a human i am.
starting to feel really guilty over ghosting my entire family i m leaving this weekend, not telling anyone where i m going and leaving my keys with a note explaining i m okay and not to look for me. changing my number and not giving it to anyone i suffer from really severe social anxiety to the point where i even isolated myself from my family. i feel like i have nothing here. no friends, no job, i messed up my relationship with my family by barely leaving my room. they all think i m awkward and weird. it doesnt help i ve become a pretty bitter and rude person over the last couple years because of how miserable i am in my life my fault i know . feel like i have screwed my life up too much, i m an embarrassment and want to go where nobody will recognize me my mom was ashamed of me ever since i started being socially anxious around 6th grade. she hated how quiet and unpopular i was. she can also be very clingy, overprotective and worried too much. i can t handle it anymore, i feel totally smothered. i just want to get out on my own even if i m living in my car for a while. but i am starting to feel extremely guilty because i know she s going to freak out when she sees the note, probably have a panic attack and call the whole family probably telling them i m missing . i feel like my parents do not trust me whatsoever and see me as some useless idiot that will never be able to have her own life i m planning on alternating between motels, sleeping in my car and working my way up to renting a room in someone s house somewhere
my boyfriend broke up with me i'm diagnosed with avpd and bpd, and my boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. i'm 18 and up until about 6 months ago i was convinced i was completely unlovable. i didn't come from such a great home, and i was bullied for all of elementary school. all i've been told, for all my life, is that i am worthless, ugly, disgusting and just a horrible person. but then i met a guy that made me feel loved, like i deserved to be loved, for the first time in my life. we dated for 6 months, then he broke up with me, because i have a personality disorder. i never told him i'm diagnosed with avpd and bpd, because even though he told me he would always love me, i was afraid that if he knew about my disorders he'd break up with me. turns out i was right. because i finally decided to tell him about a week ago, 2 days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this. he said he didn't want to be together with someone with borderline. i asked if i did something wrong, but he said he just didn't want the drama . i know i didn't do anything wrong, i never did anything to hurt him. but just because i've been through shit he doesn't want to love me. the rational part of me knows he's being an asshole, but the bpd avpd part of me wants me to think that i'm the asshole. was he right not to love me? am i really that horrible? i don't know what to do. i feel completely worthless, no one will ever love me and i shouldn't ever leave my house again. i deserve this. i don't want to do this anymore.
it's hard when loved ones don't understand avpd my mom basically tells me it's my fault i feel alone because i reject all of her offers to socialize which, i'm not denying..it is my fault lol . when i tell her i want to make new connections with strangers she tells me that makes no sense and why don't i hang with family.. she doesn't get it when i say family scares me more than strangers. with strangers, there's much less at stake. they don't know shit about you, you don't know shit about them, and if something goes wrong you never have to speak to them again. it's one and done. she also didn't understand why i wanted to work retail i don't anymore for different reasons now . she asked me how can i talk to strangers yet i'm too scared to talk to family. she doesn't understand that i just do better in work or education based settings.. you don't have to get into your personal life that much and once the day is over you go home and don't have to talk to them. there's not much expectations because they're your classmates coworkers. you don't have to let them know too much about you my mom just doesn't get it and i hate talking to her about anything at all because she gives me over simplistic solutions and lowkey makes me feel bad for having these issues when she's part of the reason why i have it in the first place. as an adult, it's my responsibility to fix this but i know what my threshold is, i'm tired of her acting like she knows me better than i know myself and she told me she knows me better than i know myself .
does anyone else ever live vicariously through other people's social media? sometimes i find myself going through people's facebook profiles usually it starts with someone i'm friends with, then one of their friends, then someone tagged in one of their photos and before you know it i'm looking at this totally random person's life. and i'm seeing all the good times they've had, the relationships, the weddings, the vacations. and it makes me wonder if i could have been their friend, or if i could have been doing those things with them. sometimes i'll think back to what i was doing at the time the post was made or the photo was taken and find myself comparing my empty life to theirs. it makes me feel like shit and yet i can't stop doing it. does anyone else do this? i don't think it's really the traditional fomo that people often feel when engaging in social media posts because i'm not sad about other people doing something without me right now so much as a broader envy of their life in general. it's not envy of someone posting pics of their nice car or fancy hotel room on instagram it's not the heavily curated, photoshopped influencer stuff. it's envy of people who went backpacking with friends one summer in college. it's envy of people watching the super bowl together. it's envy of people falling asleep on the couch with their partner while their kids are going wild playing with their new toys on christmas morning. things money can't buy. things i never had, things i don't have, things i never will have.
anyone else from a minority community, nationality, ethnic group, religion, or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years i have one parent who was jewish and one who was hispanic puerto rican. they divorced when i was young stevie wonder could see that one coming and as a result i never felt like i belonged with any community. i never learned spanish, never really learned all that much about being jewish or puerto rican my mother was americanized except the basic stuff. i was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average american culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop culture that went along with it. i've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. although at the same time i feel like i'm a failure coward because i see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and i'm white on top of that so i didn't really have it that hard. you can tell i may be jewish because of some of my facial features lol and i was sometimes teased and bullied in school work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned in a western country and has a foreign accent. even then i feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and i feel lost almost. idk, forgive my rambling... just want to put this out there and wondering if others are the same way. view poll https www.reddit.com poll 11wl0eu
childhood i just found this group recently, and it got me thinking. i feel like i was always this way, but it doesn't make sense to me that someone would simply be born this way. one of my first memories was standing behind my parents, and somebody asked them, what is wrong with him? to which they responded, oh, he is just shy. in the first grade during story time, i would face against the wall 2 feet away from everybody and just daydream. never joining in, but according to my mom, my teacher found it cute, so she never said anything. i found it embarrassing at the age of 7 when someone would call their parents mommy and daddy. i would sit with the kids that bullied me during lunchtime because i desperately wanted them to accept me. up until high school, i would constantly go to the nurses office trying to act sick so i could leave, and at the very least be able to laydown for sometime. from middleschool to highschool i found my way to kinda fit in which was through humor, gained a lot of attention but i only felt like i had 2 real friends this entire time. even though id spend countless nights crying thinking those friends really hated me any girl i liked in highschool i would never pursue because i didnt think i deserved them. im sure everyone here did this though. since the focus is on childhood, im going to stop here, but i just find it interesting how, for me, it seems i was always like this. how is it that in early development, someone can be so self conscious?
do you feel that you fit in here? or on reddit in general? i've been mostly lurking around here for many months now, and i'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like i don't belong, or i'm an odd one out. like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own, or have an understanding of what avpd means that clashes with my own, or they have fairly ordinary life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me. i don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself if avpd is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness , and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path i've taken through life. also, reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind', where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. i see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance, but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that? if you don't feel you fit in, why is that, specifically? what details about you clash with what you perceive as the reddit or r avpd culture s ? and if you do feel you fit in, especially on reddit in general, how does that relate to your avpd? is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective, something like that? that mask wearing is something i see mentioned a lot here which makes me feel like i don't fit in, as i don't do it. view poll https www.reddit.com poll 10kvhz6
i feel the need to take revenge because i was isolated i don t care if this sounds edgy i m going to mention it anyways. i ve been bullied out of school as the same with online. i ve began to develop a hatred for anyone that s not like me. i had a vent account and the amount of people who just didn t understand how severe my isolation was insane. i had so many people telling me you just want to be edgy and i even got called incel on numerous occasions for saying women and relationships make me feel uncomfortable. it felt like everytime i reached out to others on the internet what i thought could be a safe space lmao there was always someone who had to pick me apart, and find everything wrong with me. after awhile i gave up trying to reach out and now on other social media accounts i say things just to piss people off. even if i don t agree with the things i say online half the time, i just need to get that rage from some people. i don t know how this fixes anything for myself, if anything you d think people telling me to end my life for fake opinions would get me to stop. i ve come to hate almost everyone. as long as i know people were mad enough to send me death threats, i feel like i ve given them some sort of revenge. i can t do anything about what happened to me in my personal life and i hate it. i think feeling lonely for so long has made me feel anger toward those who didn t accept me. have any of you also gone through this or do i seriously need therapy?
feeling jealousy and not good enough when close friends start talking to someone else and direct most of their attention to them to be clear i'm not talking about drifting away from each other over time but rather like getting ditched where it all happens in a few minutes or less. this has happened to me a few times but the worst time was a few days ago because it happened with the closest friend i've ever had. it actually happened with them a few months ago too. i also feel bad for feeling like this and trying hard to not push them away but just can't control these feelings. a few days ago we were playing an online game together as we often do and after a while they mentioned that they were also talking to another friend while playing and i realized that was why they were so quiet compared to all the other times. i started shutting down after that but kept playing together for a few hours. we didn't say anything but i knew they were talking to the other friend instead. they did say bye when they were getting off and for the first time i didn't say anything back. still haven't said anything and feel bad cause we are the best friends each other has ever had and i know for sure it is true for them, they are not lying. but just can't help these feelings of not wanting to talk to them anymore and pushing them away. i feel so ridiculous for feeling like this like for them it's just a normal interaction with someone else and not knowing how bad it made me feel.
does anyone else keep making new reddit accounts? i find myself abandoning reddit accounts and making new ones every few weeks or so. i hate the fact that reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that i can't hide from people and make my comments and questions private. i hate the whole karma and upvotes downvotes thing. i like reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that i don't have access to otherwise. i also use facebook groups but i have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile. if i have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me i usually change my name on facebook. you are usually allowed to change your name on facebook several times a year or so. i just hate the fact that i am seen and i have built a persona, either online or offline. i just wish i could be invisible or anonymous everywhere i went including online. i also hate people knowing what country i was born in because most people are from the united states and it makes me stand out so i try and use american terms and spellings as much as i can. i also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that i am from there makes me anxious and i feel paranoid talking to people from my own country. i go back and edit comments constantly and i'm always deleting things. people automatically find this behavior shifty and i have been called out a few times and people always think i'm up to something.
just had a date, and it was neutral i've seen two posts of two extremes in the past 24 hours here and r socialanxiety , one that went well https redd.it 10tpr60 ended with a kiss and one that apparently was awful https redd.it 10tws9h but still a growing experience , so i figured i'd report my experience that was somewhere in the middle. recently had a girl message me on tinder and the conversation went really well flowed really naturally. she suggested we meet up, and considering how much i've progressed recently, i figured i wouldn't give myself enough time to reconsider doubt myself and just said yes. i was pretty chill for the most part, but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date, but it still wasn't nearly as bad as it would've been before. the date went pretty well. i was pretty nervous, but nothing that was overwhelming. we walked and talked a bunch, went to a small art exhibition, grabbed some ice cream and then i had to leave. overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness. i would have neeever in my life had thought that i'd be able to go on a tinder date fully sober. in the past i had to get blackout drunk other drugs to even text people on tinder, so i'm very very very glad i had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this, even if nothing might come of it. i'll definitely have more confidence moving forward thanks to this experience. good luck out there!
resentment i have been suspecting about having avpd for quite some time. knowing that my inability to have close relationships and function in society wasn't just my fault but is due to a condition conforts me and gives me some pointers on what to do to battle it. i really, really, really don't want to keep on living this cold, walled in hikikomori hell i was in throughout my teenage years and twenties. and boy, did i gather all my willpower to try and change my situatuon, asking this friend out over and over, trying to send them memes to make them laugh and engaging with what they were posting. they ghosted me, so i stopped reaching out to them. i gathered that they just didn't want to be around me. it really hurt and i blamed myself for beint unlikable and all. after months, i slowly started healing back again and just... moved on. recently they came out as having avpd to me and other friends and i now... sorta hold a grudge against this person. i know i'm supposed to be understanding and all because i've been there i am there, actually , but also... fuck no i put a lot of effort and courage in asking them to hang out every week, at a certain point i got tired of asking and being constantly ignored rejected especially in addition to little jokes about how ugly, badly dressed and socially awkward i was and how my bf probably cheats on me made me relapse pretty badly. how convenient to be cruel to the jobless, lonely loser and then blame it on avpd.
who else here is limerant? just wanting to get an idea of the number of people who are limerant for unavailable people. for me it's always a man in a teaching or mentorship position who is married. married because that means i'm safe. he's not going to act, i'm not going to act. there isn't going to be a relationship. the attraction is just going to float in the air like a butterfly. such intense but unattainable beauty. so much out of reach. i am in close almost daily contact with such a man. its annoying me, because i know its hopeless and could never go anywhere, but i am addicted to it. addicted to any little morsel of recognition he gives me. addicted to making him laugh. it makes my day to make him laugh. he has no idea about the depth of my feelings because i am a person with avpd and i know how to hide my emotions, even lie about them and shut everything down. my brain is basically screaming 'stay safe, stay safe.' i don't know who i am more annoyed with, me or him. i think making him laugh is the way i make him comfortable with my attraction to him. its like it must be pretty obvious i'm basically broadcasting 'i don't love you, i'm just an awkward friendly doofus, please like me.' it is intensely sad to me that this is the closest i will get to love. but even that is addictive. sad beauty. sad beauty is better than the grey anhedonia i am used to. i hope this makes sense. i hope someone understands or can relate.
how to cope with shame hello, i guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. i can't remember much of my life but i can remember almost every time i've felt shame. and i did it a lot of times. so much that even moments of my life that i had been sa are flashing in my mind all day. but other memories are just plain shame, shame of what i did in a specific moment, shame of how i reacted, what i've said, shame on how i was dressed, the way my face looked. what i recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame, and i think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. i even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me . i legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass, i wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until i made them disappear... i can remember most of the times i broke things. amp x200b how do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life? when i remember one time, i start remembering the others, they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that i will never delete those moments from existence, that they already happened, that there is no way i could live with those things that happened. i feel shame from myself all the time, but when those memories come to me i want to snap out of existence. i don't know how to deal with that. thank you.
i recovered from avpd. what will help others? i don t believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100 cured. even though i still have some avpd traits that i m still working on, my therapist says i certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of avpd. i ve gone from being a textbook avpd with such bad social anxiety i barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger. all through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought i was autistic. to now being a very socially skilled, confident, outgoing person who makes friends easily. i m curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how i ve recovered from my avpd, what helped me, how long it can take etc? i see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board. it breaks my heart when i see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message . it is possible! it s just really hard, uncomfortable, takes a lot of time and you have to really want it. thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? i m also open to suggestions of what else could help. p.s. i feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry, skeptical reaction or think i m being narcissistic. but i wanted to take the risk and reach out anyway, because i m super passionate about recovery and i d love to see the negative narrative about avpd recovery start to change.
splitting ? in avpd?? 18f just a disclaimer, i haven t been formally diagnosed yet but i relate to avpd in so many ways that i can t dive into right now. i relate way more to avpd than social anxiety but of course idk for sure. but anyway, i was wondering if people with just avpd experience something like splitting that occurs in bpd after feeling like someone s rejected them or criticised them. for example, i was having a job interview and the people interviewing me seemed really nice and i really really liked them, but as the interview went on i felt like their body language and tone of voice showed they were criticising and judging me. after i felt that, it s like a switch flicked and i hated them. absolutely hated them. i was so mad internally and all i could think of was how mean they were even tho they literally didn t do anything . i was so angry and i just wanted to break down and cry because i also hated myself too for embarrassing myself and looking weird and ruining my chance to get hired. anyway, i got the job and i love them again and can t even imagine ever hating them. this sort of thing happens to me all the time with almost everyone in my life and it s so confusing!!! except i thought it was only a bpd thing, or could it be a mix of both or complex ptsd?? does anyone else experience this often too? also i m seeing a therapist and psychiatrist really soon and i m not self diagnosing
how did you get a therapist and or an official diagnosis? i've decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so i'm not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing. i tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. after one too many what's the worst that could actually happen? questions, i just really felt like they didn't understand. this was before i had the term avpd to explain. my question is this how did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem? my guess is i'm being a bit too in my head about this, but i just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into webmd and now is 100 sure of their condition. but i also get the impression avpd isn't as common as some other personality disorders, so i want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. but nothing shows up when i search for therapists who specialize in it directly. are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? should i just focus on a depression anxiety doc or maybe one who works with other pds like bpd? or am i way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first go around? any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome. thanks in advance!
anyone else lie as a child? not sure if it s an avpd thing, but growing up i told a string of lies to all of my very few friends. it weighs on me almost daily. some were really horrible, like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. of course that s not real. i can t believe i said those things to people, but it felt like the only way at the time. through a lot of reflection, i realized that i expected rejection and wanted to control it. i wanted to make them see me as a bad person, because i didn t deserve them. but nothing in my life that i understood at the time was damaging enough to cause these problems. my family taught to me early on that if you re not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge, it s not a valid mental health condition. i didn t think i had any reason to have the problems i did, so i had to give people fake reasons to make them believe it, because my parents told me that s the only way. also somewhat of a test, like if they stay for this horrible person i m pretending to be, they ll surely stick around for who i actually am if that s better. and it s not hard to be better than that, given the severity of the lies i told. if they leave, then i ll have been in control of the rejection. and they re not reacting to the true me anyway so the judgement doesn t hurt as badly. avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.
how are some people able to not care so much? if they miss work, if they re late to an event, if someone or other is upset with them, some people don t let that shit get them down. but for me it turns into a self hating spiral of why i can t function. do you relate to holding onto and beating yourself up for small personal failures? while i m here, i have one other question. i notice my emotions and my reaction to my emotions is extremely dependent on my immediate environment. that is to say, i don t take discomfort well at all. i don t cope with thoughts like it will be over soon next time won t be so bad because i can t get myself out of the suffering of the here and now. for my life, this makes working hard, which makes money hard, which lends itself to the spiral of worthlessness. i abuse dissociative drugs for this reason, it s the only possible way to escape the reality of the present, which is often uncomfortable. the dxm actually not only pulls me away but allows me to see things objectively, and see the beauty and humor in life, how small i am and how big everything else is, things like that. i don t mean to derail, i know it s not a drug sub. but so, do you find your emotions to be a direct reaction of the environment around you, so much so that you can t avoid them, and spend much of your life actively suffering like me? sorry if this post is stupid, and if you do.
how do you make therapy work? i don t know what to do in therapy, we usually just sit there in silence as my therapist does grounding exercises saying things like notice the things around you, your breaths, all your senses etc to help with my anxiety and then she asks the dreaded question what do you want to work on today? like hell if i know, even when i do know i won t say it cause of my anxiety. i told her about my anxiety and possible avpd which we ve been learning about together even though it s information i already know but honestly at least we re doing something . i want to get deep into my trauma, my mentality, my thought processes, who i am, just everything about what caused this hell but i feel like we re getting nowhere because my therapist doesn t bring us anywhere. it s like asking a blind man for directions. i tried telling her that i like it when she leads the conversation which she has been trying, but in the end she s not leading enough. i know in therapy a therapist shouldn t lead and let the patient control their session but honestly i just wish someone would ask me a bunch of very leading harsh to the point questions with no way out so i can talk about my feelings without feeling guilty and selfish or embarrassed. amp x200b i know nobody is probably going to answer, but in the minuscule chance that you do, you have my eternal thanks and appreciation.
this sub has become a blessing in disguise for me i recently found out that i have been avoiding people and things because of fear of shame and rejections mostly. it has, to be fair affected many areas of my life. almost every single popular post in this sub, all the behaviors from reading it here and other mental health sites i find super specific to me. it all just clicked in my brain and ever since then i've been purposefully doing the very things that i know for a fact i have more than a significant chance of getting rejected or embarrassed. it feels like i'm trying to move a pillar from my chest and sometimes i just wanna die. but i'm determined. i had one major moment of rejection today and i felt awful, one of the worst feelings. but i kept reminding myself that this is the way towards betterment. facing my fears is the only way to not be afraid of it anymore. i have been feeling very uneasy but also experiencing a lot of new scenarios and feelings so to speak . i'm also very secretive and don't share a lot. the purpose of this post is also to share my vulnerability with you all from my main reddit account. in the past i would've done it with an alt 100 . i hope anyone struggling with this, find some strength from this that would make me genuinely happy. also, know that you can also get out of this. one small step for you and me, one giant leap towards betterment!
do therapists even understand avpd? i generally like my therapist. i think he's the best one i've found so far. but today's session just proved that he doesn't understand. and i admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress. but i heard the same generic advice....go out. meet people. do something fun. and that's not bad advice. probably should do that. but the problem is, every time i go out, i feel anxious, self conscious, and ashamed. i don't even think i have social anxiety. shy but not on that level. i can handle brief, infrequent, surface level conversations. anything more than that is a no go. so i seem more outgoing than i am. and it's like he focuses on my lack of relationships so that's what i bring up. i think it's because he's a solution focused therapist, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the past understanding one's self. just do it pretty much. cbt. opposite of feeling action. which is all true. but honestly, i isolate because i'm depressed. which is why i don't maintain relationships or want to put myself out there. so i don't know what to do. i don't know what my problem is. i'm just over it. older, seasoned avpd ers if that's a thing, any advice for me? should i stick therapy out or just forget it? he's like the 3rd long term ish therapist i've been with, and i don't want to dump him out the blue like all the rest.
what the hell do i do, lmao? i'm a mental cripple. i'm 25 years old, and i missed all the formative experiences in my life. relationships, kissing, having sex. dogshit family 12 years of bullying, and this is what's left. legit, what the fuck lmao? and you know what's funny? i realized this couple of months ago. i legit had no idea that i had it insanely bad up until now. drunk friend got on top of me, we made out, she started undressing, and i legit just stared at her blank. had no idea what to do, why she would do that, and what to think. that's when it hit me. i'm an absolute social failure. i can never initiate anything, i never talk about emotions, and now i truly understand the only way i'll ever have sex is by getting raped. that's it. i can't even return a fucking hug! i don't want to be like this. i'm fucking 25 already. i legit didn't care about any of that until i realized how nice a kiss felt. i can only imagine what sex feels like. i fucking hate my life. i fucking hate i'll never get to be with someone because all i can do is shut inside myself, and cry from a distance. funny thing is i'm fit and average looking, with a way above average salary. but it's all useless when i have absolutely 0 social skills. fuck my parents and fuck my bullies. i can't go back in the past. i will always be like this. i already missed on my youth. it's legit not fair.
if something bad ever happens to me, there is a chance most of the people who personally know me in life would never find out i live across the country far away from any family. for the most part, i m very lonely and have been lonely for the majority of my life due to all sorts is issues and trauma since i was a kid. i have a few friends that i occasionally meet, but i don t regularly talk to outside of that. i rarely talk to my family as i don t have a close relationship with them. i went to college and met people there, but i haven t kept in touch with anyone from college after graduating. most of the people who know me in life have no clue what i m doing or even how my life is right now. they haven t heard from me in ages. if i ever went missing, they would probably never find out. if i ever died, the people who have known me in life would probably never find out. the only people who would know anything are my co workers, doctors, and family. they would only find out if my work requested a check on me after not showing up for work for a while. family would most like be notified through that. doctors would only find out i was gone once i stop answering calls and showing up for appointments. this is just scary to think about. i ve lived alone my whole and there is a good chance i would die alone. life just sucks man. why couldn t i just have had a normal life?
why do i want to be famous?someone dm me pls why do i want to be famous?someone dm me pls this is a throwaway account. people on social media always say i m trying to get attention but wtf is wrong with that? i don t know for sure if i have avpd but i think i do i can t pay for therapy i live with my mom and i hate her i m 18 can t drive alone i always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes i speed because i m mad at my uncle. i have a job but i dropped out of school because i don t care and i have so much trauma from everything in my childhood. and anyway nothing matters now except being famous that s all i want i just have no idea why in real life i avoid people but online i have a girlfriend and i m obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because i can t stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me i don t think i could take it i ve only met her once in real life but it doesn t matter i talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and she s obsessed with me so i need her. i think i deserve to be famous more than anyone else because i ve been through so much and also i feel like i m better than most people something about me is different and i m special . can someone dm me to talk more about this? i need to know why i want to be famous and how can i get famous? also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous?
i can't fathom getting or being in a relationship with someone who is normal . 1 if i told someone i was 27 years old and never had a romantic relationship in my life and have no friends at the moment they'd run for the hills and i don't blame them. that's a giant red flag and nobody even the most empathetic people want to stick around to find out the reason for that. 2 i'm like an alien in the eyes of most people. how can somebody relate to not doing anything meaningful their lives and having the drive and motivation of a rock. most people want to strive for something grand... i'm just content having my basic needs met. 3 if someone would even give a freak like me a chance there would be no way they'd be able to tolerate me for too long. as a guy i'm sure the way i act is purely pathetic and cowardly to most woman out there. if she doesn't understand my mental illness she'll see me as not a real man because i'm so sensitive and anxious all the time about trivial things that most people don't even think about. sorry about the pity post, my family thinks one of my new years goals should be to finally get a girlfriend... easier said than done. i really don't think anyone would tolerate me and i wouldn't want to burden someone with myself. i'm convinced that i'd only be able to be with someone who has avpd or sad however destructive that relationship that may be.
all i am is a useless burden i volunteer at a place that i like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because i like helping people plus it ll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days i didn t show up due to sickness. now i m supposed to text them when i don t show up, my manager? boss? made that very clear. she even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that i absolutely couldn t take phone calls due to anxiety. now i may or may not have just skipped that part as i d hate to bother them with a text plus it s embarrassing. so basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that i can t keep not notifying them when i can t go and i have one last chance or she d rather have me not help out at all. this of course i soooo badly wanna say traumatized, because it feels that way but i ve experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasn t actually traumatic really hurt me. all i wanted to do was help. i just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all i did was end up being a burden. i hate myself for this i m scared to even go in again. if i can t even hold a volenteer position, i m sure as hell aren t ever going to be able to get a real job when i get older. i fucking hate this disease, it s taking my life away.
don't know how much longer i can take the loneliness i haven't had a bf or been intimate with a guy in 10 years. i can't fend off the feeling of desperate loneliness anymore. i've been trying tinder for the 2nd time used it for a brief period last year but never really talked to anyone before uninstalling and have been forcing myself to put in an effort responding to messages and messaging first. but it hasn't been going well...there were a few guys who i thought i was hitting it off with, but they all stopped responding to me eventually. the last one hurt the most because i had gathered up the courage to ask him to meet me. i don't know what i did wrong, i thought things were going ok, we had been chatting regularly for a little more than a week. i messaged him again this morning to let him know i was available today if he wanted to see me, and he still didn't get back to me and probably never will. i'm devastated right now. i was so happy about talking with this guy a few days ago and now i'm back to being as lonely as ever. another lonely friday night...i don't know how much more of it i can take. i don't know if i want to keep trying if it's just gong to be constant rejection. it seems inevitable, i screw everything up and drive people away with my shitty personality, i shouldn't even be surprised this happened but it still hurts so much
do you think he might be abusive? as someone with avpd, i don't date much, and i just want someone who will be loyal to me. it's very clear that he's attracted to me. i'm attracted to him too, but everyone says that i'm way too pretty for him. about two weeks into us knowing each other, he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. he s a empathetic person that cares for other people, but he gets angry over minor things. i'm 95 sure he's gone to therapy, because even though he will explode at the most random times, there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution. before we dated, i invited him to my birthday party. supposedly, a few weeks before, he was flirting with me, but i didn t pick up on it. so when i invited him, it confused him. he thought i was giving him mixed signals. on his twitter that i don t follow , he was saying stuff like playing with people s feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me . the next several weeks, he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me. he ll also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really aren t a big deal. sometimes i wonder if the thing that i did even warranted a sigh or eye roll. i m just wondering, if i got into a relationship with him, would it get worse? view poll https www.reddit.com poll 11wb7hk
does anyone find it so hard to get over a comment criticism to the point they feel suicidal? trigger warning. mention of eating disorders and suicide. a month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. he was saying how he didn t look 30 and he pointed to me and said he looks older than me . i m 24. it felt like a stab in my heart. ever since i ve barely left the house. i wasn t trying to date before that but now i m not even going to try. i feel suicidal now and i don t feel like life s worth living. i m old looking for my age so i should just give up. that comment is running through my mind 24 7. it s torture. i feel so embarrassed. if my brother knew what that comment did to me, it would suck. i m so angry but hurts. it s not really his fault how i feel but why did he say that. i ve struggled with eating disorders my whole life. i get anxious seeing my brother because i m scared of what he will say. everything reminds me of that comment. i have barely been eating. it just reminded me why i shouldn t leave the house because other people will think the same. it feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but it s taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday. how am i meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this. how do i get over it? i m not strong enough to go through life.
just a warning. but don't stop taking your meds. hello, just want to share my experience. please watch out with using meds long term. especially benzos. if you need meds you need meds. no doubts. but most meds don't heal. they're a temporary solution. i compare benzos to alcohol.. very effective for anxiety. strange comparison? no, they both make things worse in the long term. a benzo addiction is one of the worst addictions you can have. my psychiatrist putted me on them for 5 years daily. in didn't knew better 15 years ago. no internet... very irresponsible from him. the withdrawals are insane. i never experienced something like that. even more harsh compared to hard drugs well,benzos are a hard drug . and i did a lot of drugs in the past. i learned from it. 15 years ago i said for every problem there's a pill. can you imagine that? i was delusional and unaware. there's not a magic pill or drug. sorry i have to say this. maybe i'm saying well known things. but use benzos with caution. 4 weeks at max... or 2 times a week. otherwise you're in for a very unpleasant surprise that can ruin your life. but yeah... i'm not a doc...and don't stop taking your meds cause you're reading this. talk about it with a professional. ask advice. do research about the meds you're taking. meds can help a lot. but not long term. long term a big no go.
i really miss having friends i think about old friends every single day, always reminiscing about the good old days where i used to have people that liked me and i used to laugh a lot and make memories i've never since forgotten. i regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends i haven't spoken to in over a decade, making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. the only times i've ever been truly happy was just being one of the guys where i was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason i couldn't quite understand. and i just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me, with absolutely evidence to support that claim. then i spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause i definitely am not the one to do it first. i haven't had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them, they really do fill a massive gap in my life. feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing i've ever felt, but it never lasts long before they see how really odd i am and a distance starts forming. anyway sorry for the rant, just having one of those days that even though it's exactly the same as every other day, it also just feels worse for some unknown reason.
is this gaslightning? or something else? is gaslightning if someone is trying to make you believe that you are unworthy, stupid, idiot, imbecile and that you will never achieve anything in life or is this just some other manipulation? i was getting this from my sister my whole life. she was older than me and even though when she as saying these things to me i always tried to fight back and say something similar to her it didn t really work. she was older and more mature than me, so hearing it from her kind of made me believe that i really unworthy human who don t deserve or achieve anything in life. she was calling me names since i was a small child, i don t even remember times when she wasn t calling me this. i don t think that anyone would be able to gaslight me easily, but hearing it from older sister who i loved was painful for me. i don t even know if i believed these things, it just made me feel bad that my sister hates me for no reason, or for idk what reason. and that made me think that if my own sister hates me than every hates me probably, which leads to low self esteem i guess. she had control over me, when we still lived under the same roof. anything she said i did for her, like some servant. only years after leaving, i realized what was she doing to me wasn t right. is this gaslightning, or is it something else?
avoiding everything, doing nothing had a yt channel, got a decent amount of views. deleted the channel and all videos. had an account on an art website, where i spent countless hours sharing art i spent countless hours on everyday. deleted it. it had the only copies of my art. last time i sketched was 2019. used to game for hours everyday. deleted all my games and got rid of my console and tv. used to play instruments, working on an album. got rid of the instruments and the songs 100 . tried a dating app outta curiosity, got matches. blocked them, deleted the app. got interviews for my dream companies. declined them. used to love books, reading entire novels front to back in one sitting. now my mind goes blank when i see blocks of text. i had to separate the lines in this post to read it. ordered food. cancelled because i didn't wanna be seen by the driver or any neighbors. used to play sports and go to the gym daily. quit all sports and haven't been to the gym in 3 years. having stupid mini anxiety attacks because i'm scared my avoidance of everything is catching up to me and i'll be homeless. saving as much money as i can because i refuse to believe i actually have a job or deserve one. scared that the amount i saved isn't enough and i'm doomed if i lose my job. scared that my minor health issues might actually be major.
trying to explain the main difference between social anxiety and avpd one of the most common questions on this subreddit is the difference between sad and avpd. lately i've been trying to put it like this social anxiety i'm afraid they'll see how nervous i am fear of embarrassment avpd i'm afraid they'll see how inept i am fundamental belief of inferiority on top of that, avpd is more severe prevalent in every aspect of life and persistant there's no periods where you don't feel it , whereas sad is situational you might not feel anxiety in every social situation and go through periods where you feel less no anxiety . but the belief of being inferior has to be the main thing that sets avpd apart from sad. because of this deep rooted belief, every social interaction, everything someone says can be taken as rejection and therefore as a confirmation of our beliefs about ourselves. even positive situations can confirm these beliefs 'they like me now, but once they really know me they'll hate me' or 'they're only pretending to like me' . another thing is, the belief of inferiority often shows up outside of social situations e.g. avoiding doing homework writing essays or even hobbies because you feel like it wouldn't be good enough. does this make sense? please correct me if it's too generalizing. i might delete this post later
might i have avpd? alright before i start i want to say that im 16. ive been showing some symptoms as long as i can remember, but i hate self diagnosis so i want some help. because i dont want to have a pd obviously ive been extremely shy and untrusting of others ever since i was a small child. im often rude and cold to people bc im extremely afraid of someone talking to me and try to make them think im not talking to them bc im arrogant and not a loser whos afraid of everyone. but im more like the second. ive always been insecure also, i had a history of self harm. but i did that because i feel like im not enough and dont deserve to even breath the same air as most people, not because im suicidal. i had suicidal thoughts a lot but i never considered doing it because im too much of a coward for it. i also project my insecurities on people a lot and try to find someone inferior to me to communicate. ive felt inferior for so long that i want to be superior to someone so i project my insecurities and drag them down. im not jelaous by any means, i just want someone inferior to me. i dont think i even need to mention i have no friends, and push anyone that tries to talk to me bc i suspect theyre bullying me. but i have good relations with my family even though they also make me a little anxious. and i have a diagnosis of gad
it's getting harder to pretend i'll be okay my birthday was last month. i turned 26. i went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered. it was nice, but the whole time i also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life, that this is going to be my life forever. and a month out the dread is still here. it's hard to breathe sometimes when i think about how i'm closer to 30 now than to 20, over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric, and i have nothing at all to show for it. i still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. and i don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. i never learned how to drive. i've never lived on my own. i've never held a job for longer than a year. i've never had a friend, let alone a romantic attachment. most of my hometown is a mystery to me because i've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. and at this point, the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own. sorry for the melodrama. point being, i'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. and i can't talk to anyone about it, because i don't know anyone except my mom, and she really doesn't understand why i can't just force it. to be fair, i don't understand either. thanks for reading, and have a good day.
i m really sick of how superficial people have become. i mean people have always been superficial but i feel like tiktok has made this problem much worse. ive had my hair cut short for 12 years now and in those 12 years ive been treated like shit, gradually getting worse since the pandemic. i used to be so happy with myself and short hair as a women but i now feel like people are stripping me of that. i constantly get irritating comments like when are you going to grow it out? you should grow it out , i miss your long hair , i bet your hair is beautiful long! , are you in army? this one particularly bothers me because thats not the sort of way i want to present myself. i am very anti military, anti war and to be seen as a supporter of that just irks me , poor you must have cancer im sorry get well soon , are you making a statement , grow out your hair youll look better , you look like a dyke , your hair makes you look antisocial and probably more im forgetting. another thing is that ive been rejected by men before from just my hair. it hurts so fucking much it makes me never want to show my face in public again. im already so ashamed of how i look. i feel like im disgusting and stupid looking. im sick of hearing comments and being treated like this so i decided to just give in and let it grow out. i give up
is anyone else ashamed of their face? i hate my face and the fact that people can see me, i ve been told i have a decent looking face and good features but it doesn t matter, my own mental image of myself is still awful, i think of myself like im deformed or have severe facial scarring or something. it s like an inherent and irrational feeling of shame and guilt, a constant voice in my head telling me to hide my face, that other people will judge me or laugh at me for how bad i look when everybody had to wear face masks, i felt great. i was a little more confident going into public spaces and talking to people because i knew they couldn t see my face and what i looked like, it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders, now nobody wears them though so i generally wear a hood or hat whenever i leave the house, it just makes me feel much more comfortable. i think that s also why eye contact is so difficult, because when they re staring into your eyes it feels like they re looking right at you, judging you, they re able to see your whole face idk why i even wrote this just wondered if anyone else feels the same, even though it s totally irrational and there s no reason to, i just can t get rid of the feeling of hating everything about myself, feeling ashamed of it all, though mainly my face
anxiety after the gym ever since i started going to the gym , i have fallen in love with it. i look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is i might be dealing with in my head. i usually go in the evening and up until then i'm fine. but i swear that drive back from the gym and when i'm sitting in my room all alone, can be extremely excruciating sometimes. the anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky, eventually it will pop and come back down. it's just an awful feeling, and i feel it almost every time now. i wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what i'm talking about? it's such a terribly lonely feeling i get. i think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief i have that i am not a good person. i mean it's not like i'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. it's more like i treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me, it's an extremely shitty thing to do. like i see a lot of the same people every day, and i think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. but it's not like that, everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. even then, the relationships i do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.
it s like i live in different world in country where i live, there were president elections and i didn t even know about it until i went to someone i know and they asked me who i think will win president elections. it was already day after voting and they were just counting votes. i acted like i knew about it, but i didn t. like i don t watch news or anything, so i am out of loop in lots of things that are happening and i don t care much about politics honestly. i also can t vote in this country, because i am a foreigner here, so that s another thing why i don t care about it much. but fk, the thing that president elections just slipped through without me even knowing about them, i found this to be ridiculous. because it is always such a big event, how could i miss this? i also missed usa president elections i am not usa citizen, i live in europe . i learned that biden is president 1.5 year later sometime in 2022 summer after he was elected. i still thought that trump was president lol. i realized that i withdrawn from life too much, but it wasn t even my choice. it was also because of covid and that government forced us to just stay at home. i isolated myself from other people for almost 2 years, and now i am trying to go out again and trying to put my life back together.
sometimes i feel like i don't actually exist, like i'm a ghost of sorts. does anyone else know this feeling? i don't speak to anyone most days. just my mom and dad, sometimes my sister. when i do speak, my voice sounds all weird because of the lack of practice. it's kinda funny because i've noticed that despite being fluent in english it's my second language, but i've studied it since i was a kid sometimes i forget how to speak it properly. sometimes i say things that don't make grammatical sense or i don't pronounce words correctly. idk why this is happening. maybe because i rarely speak with other people that aren't my parents. no one ever notices me. in school, it doesn't matter if i sit on the back or all the way on the front, no one ever talks to me and i don't talk to anyone. i haven't had a meaningful relationship of any kind with anyone in literal years. the last friend i ever had was when i was 12. i'm 23 now. i spent all high school sitting by myself behind a tree. even now in college i'm by myself. i rarely leave my house. it's so fucking pathetic, but i just can't make friends. i don't relate to anyone. i don't feel comfortable around anyone. i feel like i'm acting whenever i interact with someone, like it's not real. i don't feel like a real person.
i can't win rant incoming somewhat recently someone at work who saw i was very avoidant actually decided to talk to me and encourage me to get more connected to people. i took some of it to heart and did just that even if it was just online. i had some nice little projects going on, met some great people but then everything just went sideways in my life all at once and now i'm slipping back into being almost entirely invisible again and i don't want to be but it feels like all i have to offer now because of it is negativity right now. in a nutshell a lot of family stuff went down and i even am now having a technical problem with my music project i can't find out the issue of and i'm just spending more and more money trying to fix it. the one thing. i found that i enjoy doing and was finally making progress with completely over the course of a single night went under for me. i swear it's like i'm cursed. everything i love turns to crap and any good times i have in life are always immediately at some point halted by complete tragic bs. it never ends and i just retreat back into myself again repeating all of the old cycles. is there anyone that can relate? i don't expect any solutions cause i don't even think there is any besides just doing my thing and moving on.
i don't want to see her either! i lost touch with an acquaintance . well, she chose not wanting to see me because she sort of blames her mental health on me, which i did not cause. i literally did nothing to this woman. she was into literature and writing and i encouraged her writing a little and we both knew about each other's anxiety. we didn't talk about our problems though. she shared she had social anxiety. she knew i had generalized anxiety, but that has improved greatly for me now. that was the extend of us knowing about each other's problems. she decided me having anxiety equated to me being a negative person and that is actually not true. she doesn't even know me well enough to determine what kind of person i am so that is part of what upset me. the other part is just the way she went about the situation. i have zero interest in ever reconnecting with her. the trust wouldn't be there and i'd always be fearful of saying something wrong or of being hurt again. see, it shouldn't hurt so much just from a little ol' acquaintance but it did hurt so much. when you live so close to each other and end up in the same public spaces at times, it is awkward and somehow, i feel like i am in the wrong for being there when i have every right to be in public spaces.
i'm a burden 20f i moved back home to help my mom lessen the load that's on her with houseworks, physical illness and a stressful season at work. i wanted to get a job to aid the financial situation and to do as much housework as possible so that she'd be relieved. instead, i'm avoiding all the job opportunities, high on anxiety if i manage to land an interview, rejecting the final offer in doubts of my ability to fulfill the employers expectations. i can't imagine myself doing any of the jobs properly so basically i don't even try them. and not only that, i've drifted into depression again and have regular involuntary outbursts of crying even in front of her. which of course puts even more pressure on her. i'm a burden, i live off of my parents, not contributing due to my goddamn diminished self worth and avoidant patterns. i have a therapist, but the sessions are just once a week and of course it takes time to establish what we're working on and to start changing the patterns. it's been a month now though and so far so avoidant and depressed. i'm starting to get impatient because i don't want to be a burden any longer. kinda wishing i never existed because if i unalive myself now, it's going to be just as much of a burden as if i stay alive, avoidant.
how do you get through the process of getting a job? i m planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. i should ve started applying for those weeks ago but i ve been avoiding it because i feel like i d either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking i ll be a valuable addition to their institution which i don t think i would be. so essentially, i ve been doing self sabotage. now, the problem is that i ve had quite a lot of absences at school, the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. i ll need references for the application process, i don t have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but i feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they don t want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they think they know i ll only mess things up. honestly, i just feel like even if i end up getting an internship somehow would be a miracle in the first place i d somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. if i don t go for this diploma i ll essentially have wasted four years of my life and i don t think my chronically depressed self could recover from that. any advice?
so i just went on a date... i'm m28, up to this point i have had next to zero experience with dating or women in general. i started chatting again with this girl that i had ghosted after asking her out on another app almost exactly a year ago. i was surprised that she would match with me again, this time i decided to go trough with it though. what helped i think is that she is of a pretty similar personality type as me, not a big time texter and sometimes slow to respond etc.. i decided to be just totally honest when we met, i told her i'm not the most exciting guy and that i'm pretty boring honestly, but i said it with kind of a smile and a good attitude. we ended up holding hands walking trough the city and i kissed her on the way to my car and again when i dropped her off. it felt like there might be some hope after all. she asked me what we should do next time, and i had no answer because i hadn't even considered it could ever come to that. amp x200b i just had to tell someone. i'm not trying to brag. if anything its an example that even if your feel inadequate and unworthy, like i do often, its mostly on the inside. i've told myself no one will ever like me, this is simply untrue, and if you feel this way its most likely untrue for you too.
i'm too patient with my parents for their own good she doesn't deserve to ask for a hug and especially not in the right to pretty much force it on me while she says she's just stressed after yelling in my face because i made a minor mistake. then complains about how neither me nor my dad give her affection. if she and i can agree the man she married is horrible, then she should be able to look in the mirror and recognize what she sees too, but no, coz she's better than him . i'm only ever patient with her and when she happens to see what i did isn't to perfection, i'm just degraded in the angriest and loudest manner possible and reminded for how i keep making mistakes. then there's my dad who is an emotionally and verbally abusive misogynistic narcissist whom i just tolerate because anytime i say something i'm deemed too young to know anything or too serious. even though i silenty seeth with anger everytime they put me down, everytime that anger and resentment fades away, i still go back to craving the love i want from them and loving them the ways i know i can that they will accept. they're very fortunate to have as good of a daughter as i am and they don't even realize it. why do i have to live with this repeated mistreatment for being human
affronting the world edit i'm not native, i directly translated affronter , but i guess face the world is more common to use made me realize how little i know about anything. once you start to avoid, it's a never ending cycle. you seek to forget the real wolrd, and once you try to avoid the avoidance, you understand how much you're behind, to the point where it seems impossible to catch up. i have dropped highschool a few years ago. never studied more, got a diploma or worked. don't really have any friend, never had a partner. i get too anxious with anything social, even multiplayer games. in the past 6 years i have left my house like, twenty times. i'm driven by avpd, and have very poor hygiene due to self neglect and depression. i'm not skilled in anything, not particularly intelligent either, definitely not physically gifted, and absolutely hideous. try to get a normal life with that background lol. i feel worthless, i have so much shame against myself, it sounds so hard. for the first time i want to find a way out and not rot in my room, for the first time i have ambitions. it's so hard. it's like living was not made for me, i think i was a mistake, not supposed to live this far or at all . i'll keep trying though. wish me luck
appearance and avpd it seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now. i'm doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist, prescription acne cream, antibiotics, clean bedding, clean diet, daily showers, face wash etc. it just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst i've seen. i'm talking big red cysts. at this point i'm convinced my lithium is causing it. i was making decent progress too. i was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. i'm trying to work up to going back to work. but i just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. if i go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how i look and feeling gross i feel as though i'm doomed to fail. if my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then i pretty much have to bail. i'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. i don't know what to do it just feels hopeless. between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations. it's much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day i've lost.
nobody in my life has ever truly known me. i put up so many masks around everybody. i show some parts of myself to some people, and other parts to other people. and some parts i never show anybody and probably never will. nobody in my life has ever truly known me, they only know the person i ve shown them. it s exhausting, but it s basically second nature at this point and i literally don t know how to be anything else. i find myself telling so many little lies even about the most mundane things about myself and i don t even mean to do it on purpose. my opinions are always what i think the other person wants to hear. every word i say and everything i show on the surface is always a watered down version of what i truly want to say and feel. even when i m just in the car with someone i only play music i think they would like or what i want them to think i listen to. most of the time i don t even know what parts of myself are true or not. i m like a puzzle made up of completely different pieces that don t fit together. it s all just so fucked. i don t know how to fix this. i wish there was someone who could see through all these masks and help bring out who i actually am, but i don t even know if that s possible at this point.
dae struggle to talk to people they like? i've been focusing on identifying people i truly personally like in therapy. or well. more like validating my own opinions, but it always comes back to people. i have a net of people i'm really 'close' with because of the way my uni living was set up. and i'm realizing through a lot of questions that there are people i just don't actually like i'm surrounding myself with? or people i want to interact with more that i know will make me happier compared to my current friend group. but i can't help but think that anybody i would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result. i think it's become a self fulfilling prophecy. the more i criticise myself the more i pull back the less i interact with people and the world and the less 'worthy' i am. but the flavor of people i enjoy are the hardworking, driven nice ones. they wouldnt gossip about me behind my back, nobody cares enough to do that. but i would feel like such a charity case. when i'm doing okay it's okay. when i'm not i hate the thought that i'm forcing my prescense on these people. that my attention to turned towards how shitty and empty i feel all the time and not the other spicy things that give life flavor.
dae have depressive zero motivation to do anything when alone i just want to sleep but i never feel rested and recovered i really want to make music but im only motivated around others i have some intrinsic motivation such as to make music but i keep getting discouraged to the utmost point by a lot of stuff dreaming of playing at festivals and having fun with people and then feeling like its just an impossible task to even try to start and to mention transgender trauma, its just not easy to interact with others and its always this doom and gloom there is no time wasted time feeling of society and its machine of productivity. i like being productive, but i hate the pressure. and if i dont feel motivated, pressure is the alternative response. kind and caring encouragement gives me space to debate when people dont want to debate it, which kindof makes sense my point is im sad. i can't live in a 2d world irl where i dont get misgendered, and using the internet just to feel a sense of alleviation from dysphoria is fake because anyone can fake anything on the internet, i wanted it to feel real as i could and i lost my insurance this is giving me a headache. i didn't want to be x i wanted to replace my y chromosome end of story
hatred, jealousy and hesitation. confession this is just something i want to get off my chest. i can't stand it. well, i couldn't stand it in middle school, it's been 10 years since, but i'm starting to have the words for it. the 3 things that i wish i could just snap my fingers and get rid of. jealousy i am jealous of many people. impersonally. i'm jealous of people who do things that make them cute, who do things that everyone enjoys and wish they could do for money, i'm jealous of people who speak naturally without any sort of impediment, especially those who entertain for a living, i'm jealous of people who are pretty. hatred goes hand in hand with jealousy a lot of the time. i also hate pretty much everyone i'm jealous of and i want to wipe them out. i want to take everything they have. no, not just a single one, but all of them. because all that's theirs is mine. i want everyone who doesn't fall to my wrath to be scared of me. to pray for my mercy. to spend every waking hour thanking me for letting them live. and that i can take everything they have with the snap of my fingers. hesitation i don't even know where to start. the world has told me everything has to be done in a way i don't know how to achieve.
i did it i gave up my old life so yeah, i did it. or atleast i am doing it. i dont't know what will happen next. it was always a distant dream of mine to just leave everything behind. maybe you can relate. i quit my job and my appartment. i left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to india. currently i am touring rajestan on a motorcycle. the only contact to my old life is my family. even though i would like to cut contact i can't bring myself to do it. it would break my mothers heart. i eat way too much seriously the food is amazing and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy. some days i don't leave my hotel room. other days i drive 300km on busy roads. you probably know this feeling. the ambivalence is killing me. i love being alone but at the same time i miss not being alone. and often i think doing this was a big mistake. the whole experience is.. meh.. and because i dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible. right now i have 50k in savings. but what for? the only thing i always hear in my head is wherever you go there you are . and atleast that's true. thanks for reading, if you have any questions feel free to ask. advice is also greatly appreciated
is it avpd? for basically my whole life i have been scared to get close to anyone. getting close to people and trusting them with personal things about me terrifies me but i want to experience it so badly. i feel as if i come across basically like a cold bitch to most people because i struggle to give out compliments, or say i love you to anyone especially family . it just feels embarrassing in a way. another thing is that i hate it when someone likes me too much because i know that i can't give them back what they expect from me and it makes me feel so guilty. i had a very average childhood with my parents divorce when i was 5 being the only significant thing i can think of. my dad and his new wife bring up to me all the time that i'm distant and cold and that i need to make more of an effort and i'm trying my best to but even just simple things like calling his wife by her name takes so much energy out of me to the point of wanting to breakdown as it's so overwhelming. i just like don't trust myself or my judgement at all and can never tell what level a relationship i have with someone is at and idk where any of this came from as i don't remember being any different is this avpd or something else?
conversations anybody else feel like they don t have the natural ability to have good conversations? whenever i m having a conversation with strangers, i m often pretty quiet and i don t know what to say unless it s work related or something i m really familiar with . i think this is normal with society anxiety though but whenever i have conversations with a group of people i m comfortable with, like my family, i feel like i suck at having conversations. if it s about a topic i don t care about, i always zone out or stare at out the window. if it s about a topic i m interested in, it s so hard to wait my turn to talk. i feel so impatient to wait my turn i can wait but it stresses me out and it s hard to jump in sometimes . it feels like i m going to forget what i was going to say or they ll change the topic before i can talk. and then when i talk, i feel like people don t really care about what i have to say. my family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. they never remember what i say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. it feels like a chore to have conversations, sometimes it s just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background. anybody relate
feeling like a creep in public on public transport so i've had this for a long time, but only now have i sort of grasped why i feel like this. whenever i'm outside, and especially in closed off public transport like the subway, i'll feel like a creep because i just stare and analyze everyone and everything. the reality is that, when i get anxious i get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me, and when i start starting at strangers, analyzing every bit of their appearance clothing posture etc, i start feeling like a creep. only recently have i realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from, vs just organically. with me being less anxious lately, i'm more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts, and then suddenly i don't feel so inadequate weird anymore. i know i've thought about this before, and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over i literally can't think of anything but the present situation. i'll literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so i can distract myself from what's in my face that second. just felt like typing this out and sharing, maybe someone can relate. much love
feeling better then worse again i know recovery is never an uphill slope but it still feels like shit when you take steps back. after getting little to no socialization for the past decade ive been really pushing myself to get out there more. ive joined a peer support organization for people with mental illness and ive been going multiple times a week. some days i feel like im making progress by challenging myself to engage in conversation and when it goes well it feels nice. but thats not every time... sometimes, like today, i feel like i dont belong and shouldnt be there. there were so many people today i just felt invisible and like i didnt matter so there was no point to even trying to make conversation. maybe it was too overwhelming or i had nothing to add to any coversations and yet i still feel like im back at square one. logically i know im not because im still going to keep trying but it just hurts to feel this way. to always feel like youre invisible and shouldnt exist. i dont want to feel like this. i want to have friends so badly its painful to be this lonely. i want to belong. and yet... i still believe i wont. im not giving up. it just sucks, personality disorders suck!
just turned to my coworker and talked one day i've always been in awe of people who can just start talking. every time i think 'i could say this!' it's immediately dogpiled with other thoughts. the self hating ones. i don't have it in me to list them right now, but if you're reading this, unfortunately you probably know what i mean. anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday, and i got my marlboros out of my locker. smoking is bad, i know . i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew , and said hey, check these out. and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton, and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries, but not here usa . i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch, because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since, especially not while 100 sober. it was nothing. and the self hating thoughts came right after. but once those settled a bit, it was nice. thanks so much for reading, i just wanted to ramble as always.
self diagnosis for this, what do you think? obviously i think therapy is extremely important this, but i also think it's one of those things that can be self diagnosed. with the age of the internet, it's easy to get into the mode of self diagnosis, whether it be for physical or mental illness. but, i feel emotionally struck by this, it's not a fun thing or something that feels relatable, it strikes me to the core and i don't want it to. i don't want this to be the reality, but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did. i'm not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth, but i've read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which i may not, but it fits so well. beyond on the symptoms, i've dung into the roots, the commo thought patterns, behaviors, etc. it's not something i feel will pull me down or become a self fulfilling prophecy, because as painful as it's been to learn about, it's something i feel refreshed by, in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself. i thought i was self aware before, but i had a lot of false beliefs and i also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors.
why do i feel like i scare people? so i am currently in college for nursing, i've been practically a hermit of a stay at home mom since 2016. i thought maybe i could get past my anxious feelings of making friends in once i got to school but it's turning into the same thing all over again. i have in person class 2 days a week and i met a girl who was open about her mental health. we clicked and i thought great i can do this i can make a friend. we even exchanged numbers which is huge for me. we texted a little but then in class she went from sitting next to me to jokingly saying i'd rather be next to insert classmates name . now i have tried to be chill with this other classmate too. we had a similar dark sense of humor, but then the past two classes i felt like a third wheel. like the first girl just started to distance and almost mean yet she asks me to study with her and the other. i am.so confused, and also feel like they are pitying me. like i just wanted to flee the class and sob because i felt like once again people automatically shut me out bc of my quirks. idk if this is an avpd thing or an autistic thing. i just feel defeated and alone. i so desperately want a friend.
im supposed to go to therapy but then we're suddenly out of budget and now my birth giver, who caused all of this, told me to deal with it . if it's that easy i wouldn't be missing school for months. it fucking sucks that everyone is undermining everything we are going through. they don't realize how this affects our literal lives. they don't see how severe this is just because they can't see our disorder. when will the time come where people take mental health seriously? if this was a physical disorder, this would've been treated a long time ago. the school doesn't even take my situation seriously. they are basically telling me to get over it . they are so fucking lucky they don't get to experience what we go through. it's not like we asked for this. fuck i hate people so much. literally the only people who sympathize with us is those who have avpd too, literally only the community itself. it also doesn't help that my country is fucking nuts and religious and don't believe in mental health. if i asked for help, authorities would literally tell me to just pray and read the fucking bible. fuck this country. fuck people. fuck everyone who doesn't take mental health seriously.
reconnected with a good friend yesterday it was really nice even though we mainly talked about tea lol and how rough life is, i wanted to hear them out and it had been a while since we had connected one on one like that we ended up chatting for hours! just between the two of us and it was really nice, i had never done that before with anyone except my family and my boyfriend. i think what made it better was how much they understood the hardship of just talking about problems, we both struggle with even talking about ourselves, went through some real shit together, and finding someone else we could really talk to without fear of anything happening was so relieving. they arent on avpd level like i am but they really get it even though it s still been really hard trying to socialize irl, i ve felt really good about my progress to reconnect with online friends lately and have real conversations more with them and my bf, and it s really helped a lot as ive been living alone and felt really lonely as of late, especially with the rough time ive had the past few weeks. it was a really nice pickup and it made me realize again how secure i can manage to feel with the right people.

does anyone else feel like they ve wasted their life so far and that death is probably inevitable in the near future? i m in my early 20s and struggle to see things getting better even though i probably have the power somewhere in me to change for the better. i guess i m just getting impatient and frustrated with myself because of the way i am. i ve been feeling low again lately and the biggest reason is probably loneliness. i wish simply talking to others wasn t a struggle and i wish i didn t view my appearance as objectively terrible amp repulsive. i wish i had things to talk about and i wish i was someone people looked forward to seeing. and i wish i knew what people thought about me, even if very few people have interacted with me. i wish i could make a positive impact on someone s life. the thing is, as much as i d like to make a friend, would the friendship even last considering i m over halfway into my university degree? people will move away and move on and it ll be back to how things were before. it s probably so dumb that i sometimes feel like death is the best outcome for me as i wouldn t have to live a life of wishful thinking. sorry for this cringy post.
things change i've been in an episode of complete isolation for about 3yrs but doing my best to claw myself out. with a therapist's encouragement i reached out to the person i love more than anything, who i've been in love with for years, and she, full of grace and compassion, accepted me back. but she is in a relationship now. i told myself that this was likely, and that i would be okay with it, but i don't think i am. i feel sick to my stomach and haven't stopped crying. how can i be a good friend when it's so painful to talk to her, when all the advice says that to get over unrequited love you should distance yourself when that's exactly what i'm trying not to do? i can't hurt her again by distancing myself without explaining why, but i can't tell her how i feel because that would be disrespectful of her relationship. i've completely ruined everything, i deserve the pain i'm feeling but i still can't cope with it. it sounds like it's new. if i'd been able to reach out even a few months earlier, i might have been able to tell her. now i feel like i've lost my one and only chance to be happy. i'm so selfish and stupid. i don't know what to do. i hate myself so much.
avpd or something else? sorry if this is actually completely normal or off topic. basically i find myself so genuinely hideous, in a you look too ridiculous to seriously expect anyone to acknowledge you as a fellow human being kind of way. it doesn't just stop at my appearance, either. it's literally every single facet of my being that is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously. it prevents me from talking to people, finding a well paying job, making friends of any kind, doing literally anything out of the ordinary including necessary appointments like the doctor or even wanting to be alive. the only person i see regularly now outside of work is my therapist who insists there isn't anything wrong with me as a person but i find it incredibly hard to believe he doesn't see just how unbelievably embarrassing and stupid i am. this feeling causes me constant distress and is completely unshakeable even though i am aware of how logically silly it is and i worry it might mean i have a personality disorder because it handicaps every part of my life. obviously no one on here can diagnose me but i guess i am wondering if it sounds similar to what you guys deal with.
people don't take this disorder seriously enough. they're acting like we're just doing this to be lazy. it's not our fault our brains are like this. my birth giver is nagging and cussing me out for not going to school, i understand that this could be frustrating for a parent, but i already told her about my problem with going to school, i risked that knowing that she's narcissistic and judgemental, but even after all the explanations, she still thinks going to school for me is easy. she then goes on to say kids these days are so onion skinned which means someone who has shallow tears and then goes on and say i didn't spoil you kids . didn't it ever occur to her that maybe i'm like this because she abused us as children? that she screams at us every chance she gets? that she didn't treat us with respect and neglected us? it's not just kids these days , people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years, it's just popular now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help. it's so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher, but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me.
hey avpd folks i could use some advice or perspectives i m in love with someone w avpd due to my pattern of getting attracted to emotionally unavailable people. which made me commonly feel unrecognized unvalued in past relationships however i want to tell you people that there are a lot of different ways people show love and can feel loved and it varies from person to person. now i need advice from you folks, i ve confessed to my person. the response to it was idk if i feel the same i need to look within but it s kind of blurry. we were cuddling so i see it as a indicator, but i feel that it s difficult. i m scared of coming too strong there but not setting frames around it makes me also feel insecure. should i try to look at it like a plain opportunity for my person with avpd to the experience of cuddling ? because i know you folks may have trouble forming trust within possible romantic relationships, and that it may take a lot longer. how ever forming a relationship out of it would take a lot effort and patience and willingness equally of both. at the bottom line transparent communication is always necessary i think wish me and your avpd comrade luck.
i realize i am the problem. the thing is, i long have realized i am the problem. but i don t want to bother people anymore with my problems. my avpd is becoming so much worse five months into my first job. i just don t want to bother people, yet people keep talking sh t about me. its justified because i keep making the mistakes i shouldn t, and i feel stupid, alone, and nervous all the time. i thought about just trying to smile and improve. even though my job is tough, i thought if i pushed through it would be okay. at the very least my co workers were nice. my supervisor doesn t like me. but i m getting more and more tired. it s like the longer i stay the more my anxiety and depression flares up again. i keep avoiding people for no reason, trying to be alone in a workplace where there s tons of people. when people look my way, i get so scared of what they are thinking. my hands begin to shake when i do tasks now. it s quite silly because the only reason i am anxious is because of my own incompetence. i just think at this point it would be better if i just leave once my department hires new employees. tldr silly rant because i m dumb amp hate my job
recovered, but it's too late i suffered from severe avpd from my late teens into my early twenties. during this time, i cut off my old school friends and then didn't go to uni. in fact, i pretty much became a recluse. i eventually started to recover when i was about 22. i'm now in my late twenties, and though i feel i've overcome most avpd symptoms, i feel like i am too old to make new friends. i've managed to sort of reconnect with 2 school friends, but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different. i really feel like i would've made my lifelong friends at uni, but i didn't make it there. i don't know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done. as i've recovered from avpd, i've realised i'm not that weird of a person, and i can actually get on with people fine. but those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed. it now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun i am, it doesn't matter, because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesn't want anymore. has anyone else experienced this? recovered but just too late the damage is done?
awful interaction, never again a talks to me, b is her friend. transcript of bits of the conversation a hi name !!! i didn t know how to answer a you re so funny, you know that? a hi name !!! panicking a you re really funny hahahaha! this repeats for very long. a omg you re so interesting i am super interested okay. wow you re so mysterious! b stop being so fake, it s so obvious. a shut up, don t listen to b. b she s lying. a i didn t know that about you!!!!!! omg b did you know that he likes this and that ? i m so excited this is so interesting! b stop he doesn t want to talk to you it s obvious. a hey name , you love to talk to me right? i m nice to talk to right? a why aren t you talking to me?? is it because i m annoying? tell me!!! a why don t you ever talk???? you re like so mysterious okay i know nothing about you! do you just not like to talk? that s so sad!!!! i was forced to give her my instagram. a to b look i got name s instagram!! such an achievement, you don t even have it! it feels like i m a zoo animal, the way she talks to b in front of my face like how visitors excitedly talk to their friends after a monkey imitates their actions.
sick of it honestly this is more of a screaming into the void post than anything. im kind of sick of just not doing anything all day, everyday kind of feels like a repeat of the same day. i'm awful at making friends, every attempt has been pretty much futile i'm still trying, though i want to be productive but i have so many issues with starting anything i run away from everything even though i'm well aware that'll cause even more issues, but anything to delay the pain i guess i'm awful. i need to make changes in my life but it's so hard, and any change i make just makes me wanna go back into my reclusive life. whenever i see anything about people my age or younger achieve something that i never will, i get pissy but i don't do anything to better myself afterwards. i used to workout as a way to be productive but man, i have a chronic illness that just makes that impossible, now i feel like a complete total loser. i used to be one of those gifted kids and everyone had such high expectations of me, but now i'm just a loser with underdeveloped social skills. i almost feel like there's no one in this world that's dealing with the same issues.
i know this probably isn't avpd, but sometimes i suspect i have a bit of it due to symptoms, but that doesn't mean anything school sucks. all i do is hide the bathroom every break time to avoid social interactions because i also know there isn't anywhere to go or sit. if there is a place in the library, i hope that nobody sits next to me or looks at me. i think people stare at me, but when i look up, they're not. i wish school days went faster and feel like i get anxiety attacks. i avoid making friends at school because i feel inferior to people. like, i don't deserve them, and they're much better having someone else as a friend than me because i have 0 social skills and stress to maintain friendships. i try to seem mildly interesting by having hobbies, but i know it isn't enough. i sometimes feel severely lonely and depressed at school and at home but try to distract myself from that. i don't speak a word at school. somedays, i dissociate, and everything feels like this isn't my home or i'm dreaming. i think this is just general social anxiety, but do any of you relate? btw, i'm not trying to self diagnose. i just need some help...
how do you feel about becoming a parent while having avpd? i'm going through a horrible situation with my reproductive health. until the point of having to get treatment for conceiving and all ,as my tests are showing i don't have much time left for postponing getting pregnant. the thing is that at 25 my recently diagnosed avpd has destroyed me. even though, i have a career ,i'm financially stable and got to organize my life a bit. i don't have quality of life. i'm so anxious i can't even function worried about what the neighbors around my apartment might think of me. i still leave the house for going to work but sometimes i'm so freaking exhausted i cannot take care of myself. and i can't stop but wonder if becoming a parent would be a good idea for me or if it will be better to forget about it as i seem to be a person who doesn't fit into the scheme of a good parent. i used to dreamed about having babies back when i was younger but now i think that would be the most egotistical decision i could ever take,specially for a child that didn't ask to be born or have a trashy parent like me who cannot even go to the supermarket alone.
is anybody mainly scared of simply being perceived? like i don t really care if they think i m dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying. eye contact is the absolute worst because it s 100 percent focus. i always try to look people in the eyes but have to look away within a second otherwise i feel like they ll hate me. i m 24m and it s waaaay worse with women, i feel like i m invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point i don t even know what their face looks like after an interaction. when my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie i will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. but i can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. i also feel like i have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if i go to a restaurant i will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time. i just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like 90 percent of my stressors. okay this got way out of hand im baked goodnight and if you re reading this i love you
everyone stares and judges you leaving the house is so difficult because no matter where i am i can feel like every single person is staring at me and making fun of me or judging me. when i walk outside i can feel the stares from everyone in their cars. when im on a bus i can feel the eyes of every single person on the bus. even when i just get out of my house i feel like the whole neighbourhood is staring at me. i know ive been experiencing this for a long time. definitely since i was a teenager, i grew my hair out so that it can cover a lot of my face because i felt like people were doing that. my first memory of having anxiety i was 6 and i was late to school and was too afraid to walk in the class because everyone would look at me. it took me 10 mins just to walk in and then because of that my teacher yelled at me in front of the class. i would feel sick before presentations in elementary school and didnt know why. any kind of attention on me scares the living shit out of me. i dont know if this is avpd or not but it causes me so much distress. it doesnt help that i didnt leave my house for many years and was agoraphobic.
i can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life i'm in my 40s now. the last time i had friends was in school. i'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. actually i'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. my friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends, i.e. other outsiders. we'd meet to play computer games, or sometimes rarely go swimming. but we never really talked about personal stuff. i'm not even sure this counts as friendship? anyway...so i've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. i think i really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on tv or remembering childhood friends. is it more than spending time together and watching tv or engaging in hobbies together? am i even capable of friendship? consequently, friendship isn't something i've been looking for. maybe if i knew what i'm missing out on, i would? i'm about to embark on a psychotherapy journey again, and i feel unprepared. what do i even want?
my first day at the job it was awful, i hated it and i am so afraid of going in there again.. i don't want to go much into details but the whole day i kept forgetting every fucking thing i was told. i kept zoning out, asking a lot of questions a lot of times the same kind of questions again and again , being slow because how much i was overwhelmed. i kept telling myself that i am giving it my best, it's my first day and no one should expect me being immediately perfect in this but it didn't really help. i needed to do a lot of multitasking, to keep my eye on multiple things but it seemed that i just couldn't focus. in the end i felt extremely inferior to all my co workers. whenever some of them would remind me that i was forgetting something doing something wrong etc i felt so attacked, crushed, judged... at some point i even nearly cried but i could suppress it. god, i hate this shit. i am aware that 99 of those thoughts i have are completely inadequate and irrational, i am certain that they were just trying to help and guide me, since i am new in there. but why doesn't it help with feeling less worthless..
is freezing during a conversation an avpd symptom? hi all! i'm new to this subreddit, i was recently diagnosed with avpd. i'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it. the thing is, i don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks i know, like my colleagues and friends, i'm even more than average social. however, i do notice that i'm... slow in social interactions. i mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and i can't answer properly in the moment. or i can't hear someone properly but i'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves ?! so i just kinda freeze and or act as if i heard what they said and the conversation goes on. then later i think of a correct reaction and can't for my life understand why i shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then. this happens with friends too, although it's more common with folks i'm not that comfortable with. is this an avpd thing or just a me thing ? tl dr is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an avpd thing?
i'm literally too awkward for therapy i'm doing cbt and my therapist always asks me what i'm thinking and all i can say is i don't know because my mind always goes blank. i can't articulate my emotions either and don't even know what i want in life. today we did an exercise where i was supposed to have a conversation between my critical voice and my confident voice . i told her i'm extremely uncomfortable doing it and she said it's fine we don't have to but i wanted to try it anyways. i could think of hundreds of things i hate about myself but not a single thing i liked about myself. it was so awkward sitting there and not saying a positive thing. my therapist even asked me if i'm having any suicidal thoughts afterwards, that's how bad i must have looked. when i looked in her eyes she seemed clueless, like she's never seen anyone that bad and has no idea how to help me. i don't believe my problems are something i can fix by just changing the way i think about myself. i am not an interesting person. i'm not an attractive person. i just feel like there's nothing of value about me and people find me repulsive.
i'm trying to solve an internal issue externally and i know this wont work but idk what else to do. i just genuinely hate myself and i hope that maybe if i hit my goal weight i can finally have the confidence to talk to people and not feel so awful. every social interaction feels like i'm being analyzed under a petri dish. logically i know this isn't true but it feels true. this causes me to put on an act, which causes me to not be present with people, which causes the awkwardness that i fear. i'm focused on my facial expressions, if i'm saying the right words with the right tone of voice. my mind goes blank half the time. i know that people typically enjoy it when you ask about them and their interests. yet for some reason i just struggle to talk. i start stuttering, slurring my words, or going so overboard on sounding perfect that i sound like a robot reading off a script. . i just want to relax and enjoy myself. sometimes i'm able to. most times i'm not. i'm always waiting to feel embarrassed and then i go back to isolating myself. the motivation for change is there but i'm soooo scared and exhausted.
i went to a party! i actually went to a garden party! there were tiny sandwiches, a bunch of fruit, and little cracker plates with meats and cheeses. i actually felt comfortable the whole time! i've been on some medicine these past few weeks i can't remember the name and i think they may actually be working. i still get depressed and or anxious around the night time or when i'm not doing something. i just have to keep myself busy and i'll be okay. but about the party. i knew almost everyone there, i've known them for a long time now and they're closer to me than my family. i helped set up the party so i didn't feel like i wasn't being useful, i took my time this morning in making sure i looked presentable, and of course i showed up early just in case. the party lasted about an hour and a half, and i even got to talk with some of the people there! today is just a great day so far, and not if but when things start to go back down to normal, i hope i don't forget that i was able to be happy today. i know progress can jump forward just as much as it falls back, but i'm going to celebrate today as progress!
good or bad person does anyone else struggle with figuring out whether theyre a good or bad person? im not sure if others have that moral at the top of their list but thats how ive been since i was a kid. the most important thing to me was being good. ive strived to be a good person for most of my life and i know that humans will be humans and its not all black or white, you can be a good person and still do bad things but i just cant help but feel like no matter how hard i try to be a good person im still treated like im a bad person so that is what i must be. if i am a good person then why am i treated like im not and why are the bad people treated like theyre good? why are the people who turned me into this miserable soul living a happy life while ive been in hell reliving the torment every year since i was a child? i dont believe in religion but i was raised catholic so part of me still thinks that life should be that way, good people are happy and go to heaven and bad people are miserable and go to hell . i know theres no hell and yet i still fear there is. i think i might be living it...
how much of your avpd surrounds your appearance? i've been told i'm pretty but i almost never believe it lol. i don't like attention of any kind, good or bad. i noticed that i have this weird perfectionism that i have to look good for people. ofc you want to be presentable but i take it overboard. i won't leave my house if i feel too badly about my appearance that day. i feel like i'm offending people by not looking good. i'm pretty sure this stems from ofc, childhood. i didn't care too much for looks as a kid, i just wanted to have fun. but my dad would constantly judge my hair, want me to change my clothes so i can look better. every thing was about appearances with him. he would constantly look at himself, even in windows while walking out in public. he'd spend hours getting dressed despite having no hair, so i don't get what took so long . i noticed i've picked up the same habits. i care far too much for my appearance when logically i know most people don't care. and if they do care, that's kind of weird. are you like this? how does your appearance play into your avpd?
looking for some good vibes hello everyone, i am writing this because i've been reading posts on this sub for the past week, since i've learned about avpd from my new therapist and researching about this disorder, as i believe i also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people. unfortunately, not to make anyone feel bad about it, as i know this condition is very hard to live with, but i have been trying to look for some success stories from people here, or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life. so my question for you, especially maybe for the older people here with the condition,or the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of success , no matter how small, what is your outlook on life? what advice do you have regarding managing this condition? although i've also had a rough couple of days, i'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help. please share anything you'd like that might help me and others on this sub.
my life is wasting away while everyone is building a good future for themselves. it seems like everyone i know is set for their future. my two best friends are currently studying in big reputable schools studying chemical engineering and business, something that will help them achieve great goals in the future. while i'm here rotting away in my house doing the same thing everyday because i'm to fucked up in the head to go to school and finish high school. i'm afraid everyone would move on with their lives and i'd have to deop out of school and repeat again. i would be graduating at 20 when i should have been graduating at 18. it would be completely ok if i was rich, but i'm not. i can't afford to slack all day and do nothing, but my pathetic brain stops me from doing anyhting. before my country adopted the k 12 curriculum, everyone graduated at 16, goes to college uni for 4 years, and graduated at 20. now i'm barely graduating at 19 years old. it feels like everyone i know is gonna be rich and successful in the future and i'm just gonna be here rotting my life away.
i have to tell my family i dropped out of college, immediately it s all coming to a boiling point. my mother says you need to go into what you need to do for graduation or if you are not doing the ceremony then please be kind enough to tell me now. of course, i ve known for months that graduation is not happening. i m too afraid to tell them and admit i m so sick. i ve been lying the whole time and i feel disgusting. but even if i m too afraid to tell them, they will know eventually there s either a ceremony to attend, or there s not and come to their own conclusions of me. they are extremely abusive people, and i know they are going to shame me severely. they are the reason i even have this disorder in the first place, and now i have no choice but to sit there and let them blame and shame me for having it. i can t handle living alone right now, or being completely by myself. i feel i have no choice but to throw myself into the flames and let any confidence i had left burn away pain is the only option i have, on all sides. i don t know how to deal with any of this.
a poem i wrote in high school i was clearing out my apartment today and found this. in high school i sent it in to be posted anonymously in a yearly book of poetry that my school made. to my horror, i found out later that it wasn t anonymous. i had no idea what avpd was then, but it is shockingly relatable to look back on now. hard to post, but it feels important that i do. i want to be understood but cannot be vulnerable. the one who shows their hand first loses. carve into me and leave your mark the first one to strike feels betrayed most the retaliation is serrated but i just wanted to know you without borders, without pain i just wanted to know you you like me if you can assort me, label me and pin me down aggressive bitch, salty witch, innocent dreamer, batshit idealist. you color me all kinds of elegant but when it comes down to it, i m only an impressionist. i keep trying to break free of what comes naturally to me, find myself in the labels you offer me, but the mirror image is fake and so am i i want to feel myself without your hand in my definition.
how to deal with in person avoidance? hi dear community! i have a question, my partner has avpd. we have been dating for some months. and i noticed that when he s going through an anxiety episode or moment. he sort of physically avoids me. for example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. he will hide behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can t actually leave. for example when we share a hotel room on vacation i did notice that when i grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but i m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that i m gently being reassuring and consistent. my dear avpd ers when feeling low, do you like being comforted, or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? i just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable! thanks everyone !!
i ve decided to opt out of this disorder lol i m not an extrovert, i don t want attention, i m okay with being silent, i hate small talk, i want deep connections that come from a place of mutual patience and empathy and i m sorry to admit this so late, but i won t find that with like 99 of people. it just is how it is. what i ll try to work on i ll allow myself to fail, stutter or mumble when i don t feel comfortable talking in groups, but i ll talk nonetheless when i have something to say so that i can practice that which i m not good at. which means i ll allow myself to feel discomfort. deep discomfort and shame, which i know, will lessen one day or i ll get used to the feelings. i ll allow myself to be intimate with people i feel comfortable with. and to warn them when i feel like fleeing and hiding. the right people will understand and won t give up so easily. i ll accept failure, expect disappointment and revel in misery because i know it will lead me to something better than this dark void i ve been living in the last years of my life. thank you.
dae overreact when they make little mistakes? tldr i tell myself to kms after making insubstantial mistakes. i could really use some reassurance i made a tik tok post about a band i like and i mixed up the names of the members, misspelled the renowned venue they played at, and accidentally said one of the members passed away. two ppl in the comments pointed it out and now i feel like ripping my skin off. instantly i started saying to myself, you should honestly just kill your self, what s wrong with you, that s so embarrassing, kill your self over and over. sometimes i picture myself being impaled or shooting my self in the head. this happens all the time and it s one of the most debilitating parts of this disorder though i m not diagnosed . any time i remember something slightly embarrassing i did even 5 years ago i have a totally disproportionate reaction to the embarrassing thing. does this happen to anyone else? i feel like i m doing much better than i was a couple months ago but this persists. i hope this isn t too upsetting to share for anyone.
getting out my comfort zone i m a 24 year old female and i ve had a lot of mental health issues. one of them is avpd. i struggle to maintain friendships because i always push them away out of fear they will see the real me and i think i m an empty person with no personality. i never developed my own personality. i always mirrored people to fit in. i have an intake tomorrow for a rehab clinic. i m addicted to xanax. i think the addiction is just a result of my mental problems that are really complicated and go far back into the past. after the rehab i will go to portugal for an intense treatment for 2 months all by my own. no phones allowed. i think it ll do me really good and i m glad i have this opportunity. i know they aren t going to fix my problems and i need to do it myself but it is a big step for me to travel alone. to really work on myself. it s a step forward. i have had really bad weeks but this is a little bit of hope for me. sorry i just needed to vent and i hope you all are doing okay even if you take baby steps be proud of yourself!
high functioning avoidants i don t know if this is even a thing but i feel like it describes me. i have no problems talking to people, especially strangers, yet i have no follow through if they show interest. i ll get invited for dinner, coffee, etc and always make an excuse. i did get married twice but left quickly as soon as things became difficult and while i was in them i was very much a loner. i had no desire to go out with friends, do things with family and such. i start projects with earnest and get so excited about them yet can t follow through to finish them. even on reddit, i have no problem starting a conversation yet when someone replies it puts me in flight mode, i m so afraid i ll be seen as dumb or unlearned. or that my opinion isn t worthy of a response. i have the get up and go that got up and went i guess you could say. i m trying to work past it though and not just react in the moment anymore and instead take my time, and push myself to follow through. i don t want this disorder to control me like it does. can you relate?
avpd diagnosed recently hey all, i was diagnosed with avpd quite recently and finally i guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me. i finally got an appointment at psychologist, we were doing for the first few hours screening process, turned out i do have avpd and i met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with bpd. also he mentioned that i do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. but after i read his diagnosis this evening, he wrote that i have other personality disorder . which idk how i feel about that. like i do not belong to anything even in this. and when i started to talk to him about feeling really depressed, and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today, he just said that we will talk about it next time, in a two weeks. and i am so confused about this, like no one really care, especially with the suicidal thoughts. and feeling i do have no one to talk. or maybe i don t want to? i don t know. but this is making me super super lonely and more depressed. no one really cares..
where did my avpd come from? so i am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusive narcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition. but i don t think that it comes from that. i couldn t have had better parents or family they supported me, respected my opinion and so on. i have the feeling that i always was like that even in kindergarten back then. the only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as i was 6 years old but i guess that s not the most uncommon thing and that my father is also very socially avoidant. could it also be the latter like in a learned behavior? or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that i just forgot and don t remember don t think is significant enough? often i ironically feel a bit isolated when i see comments on youtube or reddit talking about the reason for the avpd because i can t relate at all to their stories thankfully tho, but you know what i mean
hopelessness too lateness is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? too late to try too late to get treatment too late for anything and everything? too old? or if someone is too badly off? i've seen some people around reddit and the net refer to failed lives. i've recently made posts and tried to look around reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be nobody . and the only conclusion i can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. and avpd along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. growing up or developing avpd in a family full of npd didn't help. most subs seem to skew younger, which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. how has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness? feeling too old and that it's too late to change anything satisfactorily? does anyone have other issues diagnoses that mix with avpd to just make things impossible?
i'm grieving a three day long situationship worse than people leaving a three year long relationship i have bpd, and two and a half years ago, i met a guy on a trip. we only hung out fro three days, but our conversations were so interesting. we spoke about politics, education, etc. he told people he liked me. i was so excited that he liked me. usually i don't take big leaps like this, but since we live in different countries, i went up and asked him if he liked me. he told me he had a girlfriend, and he cut off all contact with me. they broke up two months later, and i'm 75 sure he's been stalking my social media since then, but he hasn't reached out to me. i know it's been a long time, but i miss him so much. i miss him. and i cry about him everyday. i need him. i just feel like i'm stuck in this pit of despair. and i've tried to change. i've dated other guys. there's another guy that i like way more, and i know he likes me too. but there's still a part of me that misses the vacation guy. i don't know why i feel so stuck.
i don t think i have the capacity to be a good friend the last time my only friend was in a terribly dark place i left her messages unread for two days, and when i finally felt like i could actually handle responding i could barely come up with two pathetic fucking sentences. i appreciate that she left it on read and hasn't brought it up again instead of telling me just how absolutely shitty and unhelpful i was. now, she's tweeting about feeling stranded on a desserted island by myself, less than an hour ago, and i feel like such a selfish disgusting piece of shit but i don't know how to comfort her or be there for her at all bc i don't feel like i can handle it. i can hardly handle my own bullshit. i can't be of any help. i can't even just listen and be a shoulder to cry on good enough bc i'm too much of a coward. i think i just deserve to be alone. to rot. i'm not worthy of connections or relationships. they're meant to be two sided and i can't hold up my end up the bargain. i hope i die alone so i stop hurting people.
i act like a child and idk if it's just me or because of avpd people have commented before on this, and what it is, is that i basically look up to people in the way a child would look up to an adult, and i do this because i admire how other people my age act like real adults, and are confident and capable of doing adulty things. i absolutely am not a real adult, despite my age. i also tend to want these people to look after me a bit make me feel safe protect me from other people because i view them as competent whilst i'm essentially an over grown child. i suppose this could stem from childhood trauma where i didn't feel protected maybe, so i now try to hide behind other people to feel safe. i don't know if anyone else experiences this. i've never seen anyone talk about something like this before so i fear i'm just a complete weirdo . i'm not sure if this is actually a sign i have dependent personality disorder or something instead of being avpd related. hopefully you guys can let me know if this is avpd related or not.
i got a raise i've worked as a baker at a cafe for a little under a year, and here bakers are supposed to also answer the phone and take orders have some cashier training, which i just... couldn't really do, so we worked out a tentative agreement for me to only do opening baking, which is only about 25 hours a week. today my boss told me that i've been doing really good work and that he's over me not answering the phone because it's obvious i care about what i'm doing. now i've got more hours responsibilites, the same days off every week, pto, and a 2.50 raise! i started here when i was still in high school so this kinda feels like i've done something to prove myself as a real employee even though i never really think i'm doing good at all. but it gives me so much hope that even if i'll never be 100 with communication there's still good qualities i have and people can appreciate them. the thing i'm happiest about is that they know i care. because i really really do and i didn't think there was any way to express it.
i m scared of going to college i m a senior in high school and after being on this subreddit for a month i m terrified of going to college. granted i was terrified before that. before i figured i d take a gap year to figure things out and i didn t feel like i was in a good position to do well in college. but now i m realizing i was just avoiding applying because i was scared to be rejected. or maybe i was scared of what would happen if i was accepted. i don t know what i want to get into and it s scary how relatable a lot of these post feel. and what scares me more is that i keep seeing posts about people having to tell their parents they dropped out of college. is that going to be me??? am i just going to be a drop out?? should i even try?? i don t know but now i m worried i m going to get to comfortable once i m out of school and will be too scared to return. uuugh everything is so frustrating i wish i could just be normal and i don t know what to do but i m curious to know other people s experience with college
ae feel like this? i m 24 and don t have a stunningly high body count, it never used to bother me but once i hit my 20s and people i knew hit that phase of sleeping around and doing the casual relationship thing it just hooked into my brain i tried to do the whole hoe phase thing but i m terrified of everything around being more intimate with someone, making moves, doing things right, my own body just not being able to keep up the act ive got going and having to have someone see all of me, you know? and on paper i know it s fine not everyone on earth is hoeing it up, either side of the spectrum is fine, but my brains really latched onto this as another thing that makes me different from everyone else and something people are going to judge me for. like i m not a person because no one s ever really wanted me. amp every time someone brings it into conversation i just feel physically sick with how much of the biggest freak i feel like i m sorry if this barely makes sense i just really needed to get this off my chest
out with friends for the first time in a long time.. can t leave.. went out with an old friend for her birthday in a city two hours away from where i live. things were going well but i m getting the feeling i annoyed everyone and no one wants to hear my voice anymore. i can t excuse myself and go home, and i also feel rude saying i m going to bed first. i m the only single person here, and there s so many years of bonding and inside jokes i ve missed out on. you know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if you re your lucky , but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on. i also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now i just feel like i overstayer my welcome. i m stuck here until tomorrow morning when we go home, and i have no one to talk to because this girl i came with is my only friend. i feel like shrinking and making everyone forget i was ever here.
anyone else idolize friends from their past? i hold onto memories of people who have left me seemingly endlessly. good ones, bad ones. perhaps because i believe they must be some kind of special person to have enjoyed my company. i think my connections have always been more deep for me than the other person because i m desperate. i wish i wouldn t remember them. wipe it all clean. constantly being hit with intrusive thoughts of everyone who isn t around and how difficult those relationships were is exhausting. i had a dream about a close friend who abandoned me justifiably, not even my self esteem talking, i was a shitty person then reconciling with me over lunch. extremely vivid, and i felt so at peace after our conversation. so glad that she wanted to talk with me again. then i wake up from this bliss, all alone. go to school, alone. come home and make dinner, alone. go back to sleep, alone. it s absolutely crushing to be so alone and feel like you don t have the tools to come back from that.
what should i do if i strongly suspect avpd? i've struggled with mental emotional problems pretty much all my life. even as a young kid, i was very shy and anxious. that morphed into more severe problems as i became a teen young adult. now, at almost 30, i'm really frustrated because nothing gets better for me. doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or adhd, which i do have problems with, but it seems like there are more fundamental, deeply set issues which go unaddressed. i've been interested in psychology since i was a teen, and there have been times where i've considered that i might have avpd before forgetting about it, but recently i began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me. it's kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts amp experiences. where should i go from here? how can i bring this up with my psych or should i bring it up? would getting a diagnosis be worth it?
irritated with oppression olympics between avpd and schizoid pd t w angry rant ahead what the hell is the oppression olympics between avpd and szpd all about with some people on this sub? there are all these casual mentions of things like well my life sucks but at least i m happy i don t have szpd that keep showing up lately. why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience social anhedonia ? it s not the only symptom experienced by people with szpd, although it seems to be simplified into that. i don t understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they don t experience social anhedonia. experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with schizoid pd. it would be like saying people with adhd are choosing to be inattentive. also, there is a lot more to szpd then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on. end rant
i d rather be alone than feel like this went on a date a week ago for the first time in years . normally i am not attracted to people, but this time i felt super attracted to this person. good talks and the whole day we spent together. we had sex, but i did not sleep at that person s place bc that s too intimate for me i see sex a something purely physical, but sleeping is too scary for me . however that person didn t text me for a week, so i texted to ask to go to a concert with a mutual friend. still no response for 2 days . i feel so insecure and rejected and it confirms the negative view i already have about myself. i really would like to have a relationship and fall in love, but even dating makes me feel so worthless, ugly, stupid and anxious even after one date . sorry for the vent but this is the only place i feel i can share this. other people say that i just need to relax, stop overreacting and stop being insecure and blablabla. that s why i never share these feelings with people
so tired of everything i am so goddamn tired of everything. i am not looking forward to anything, have no goals..just a low paid job that i don't really like. i guess i can be proud that i got one in the first place, despite how horribly painful that was to get used to it and my thoughts about quitting it after first week. but honestly, other than that, i have no clue why i am doing all this. i mean, everything..going to job, eating, trying to do something..living. i am so tired i barely drag my body to work or practically anywhere. about my job..i got more or less used to it but i still feel like my co workers hate me. it's my avpd brain acting up, again. goddamn pesky little thing. they're nice to me but this irrational part of me wins every time every day is a misery and i am so tired.. i always tell myself that i have to go forward and don't stop but by now i am not sure why or where i am going. feels like i am just aimlessly wandering around in the darkness with no clue whatsoever
can t stand people with the same interests anybody else? i find i get very jealous when others share my same interests, yea. i know it sounds like im an asshole. this feeling has been stuck with me since i was little. like when someone mentions they have the same interest, i immediately feel worthless. its like, wow okay. who needs me? nobody. i don t stand a chance. or someone posts about it and a bunch of other people are also into it. i feel so bland and competitive and ready to give up. they know more than me, they re better than me, im not cool or special, they will succeed and i wont. the other day i saw a post which mentioned my future career idea, which was somewhat uncommon. 20k likes. i felt like giving up because i just feel so small and useless now? i dont know how to describe it really. i know this probably sounds like im looking too far into it.. edit thank u for the comments. glad to know im not alone in this feeling, and thank u for the advice some of u gave.
making changes in a terrible depression tw lightly suicidal this week i have to begin fixing my life. i don t have a choice in the matter. i will need to see a new psychiatrist, and a new therapist. i need to get a job, i need to eat. i have so much to do to fix myself before i can even start with the basics of life. and worst of all, i have to be honest to heal. i m not even honest with myself. i just smile and nod to everyone. no one takes me seriously, because i m always laughing and joking. i can t turn it off. like when your parents say keep making that face and it ll stick that way forever, i got my face stuck in a clown mask. i feel like a shriveled, dehydrated soul. like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain. i m horrifically depressed, the worst of my life. and honestly the effort just doesn t feel worth it. i d really rather just rot and die. i m so terrified of all this, i d prefer to die. but i couldn t make that choice either. i am trapped on all sides.
i quit my job without telling my boss so i work as a cashier and this saturday 28th was supposed to be my last day there end of my contract, which was going to be renewed but last saturday 21th after my long shift i decided i couldn't go through another week at this workplace so i took all my stuff and left for good without telling anyone. this job has burnt me out so much and gave me panic attacks and i didn't see myself staying there another week. but i was mostly afraid to tell my boss that i didn't want to renew my contract, too scared to see disappointment on her face and to let them down... so by quiting early i wouldn't have to face this situation... i didn't show up on monday and didn't call, but i sent to hr a doctor's note from my psychiatrist telling them that i am taking a break from work. my boss has tried to call me yesterday but i didn't respond. i feel shitty right now and i hate this avpd.... this fear of confrontation and disappointing is killing me.
its becoming impossible to keep avoiding my life without real consequences well, real consequences already happened, and i avoided facing the feelings that wouldve prevented them from happening but now my parents are threatening putting me in a halfway home or making me live with them again, them saying they would sell the house, which utterly terrifies me but in the face of how my life has gone, suicide is also a considerable option, tho not one i can follow through on but its becoming easier to every day its amazing how the economy and life can utterly ruin people, isnt it why is it so hard for me to speak in my own voice oh right, the trauma its really hard to drag them out of it as their minds resemble mine far too much and mine resembles theirs far too much the pain of having to get a job while also not even being able to be myself in real life is really depressing, i feel like just another person with unfulfilled dreams forced to grow up and accept reality
does anyone else do insane mental gymnastics to get out of going places? i swear, some of the reasons i've come up with in order to avoid meeting people... it's so crazy, like why can't this creative energy be harnessed anywhere else? for example i've literally riden a 30 minute bus to a place, walked right up to the door, then heard the dreadful sound of people inside.. and that's all it took for me to make a 180 and ride that same bus back home. the reason in my head was like hmm, they're meeting next week so i can just wait until then, surely i will do it next time d it's just, ahhhhhhhhh i hate myself man. why why why why why why why why why am i like this and the thing is, i really need the socialization too, like i'm so freaking lonely... the instant i arrive back home i'm like shit i really should've just gone in, now i have nothing to do again, why did i listen to myself and it just makes me even more depressed thinking about how pathetic i am
at this point i don t think there s anything in this world that can cure this innate sense of loneliness inside me. am i destined to be like this forever? relationships seem pointless, and i don t know if i could even handle being in one anyway. i ve basically been alone my whole life and i don t know how to be anything else. i ve never even had a crush on an actual person. it sounds conceited but nobody i ve met is interesting to me in that way, and i feel like if i gave someone a chance i d just end up breaking their heart because of this nothingness inside me. right now i can t even imagine myself being intimate with anyone, and i feel like i m not emotionally available enough to have someone rely on me like that. they d probably end up feeling more like a burden to me more than anything, and i don t want to do that to anyone. i really hope one day i m wrong and i ll meet someone that makes me feel a little more human, but i don t have much hope.
i can't tell if i'm jealous of other people i think i like my life when i am alone. i am happy to be by myself, do my work and my chores, and i have hobbies that bring me joy. but it feels as if it all comes crashing down and a heavy sense of depression and grief hangs over me as soon as i'm reminded that other people do fun things together. i don't want to join them because most of the time having fun with friends isn't actually fun for me, but the feeling persists and can go on for days. i know it's silly to feel resentful of these other people and it makes me resentful towards myself as well. i just want to make it stop. ex driving my sister, who is still in high school, to hang out with her friends or go on dates. i'm only a year older than her and afterwards suddenly my existence is in a different focus and i remember that objectively it is very dreary that the most exciting thing i have done in a month is watching my spinach sprouts grow.
have people always been experts in giving advice? is this something new to our generation gen z ? or milennials? or has it always been a thing? why does everyone feel like they are experts in what everyone else should do? especially when something bad happens. and most of the time, it's something vague or obvious. break the cycle you know better than this just be grateful for what you have live in the present use the resources you've been given make something of yourself, anything, but don't let your life go to waste . and every single time, they're very fucking happy with themselves. nothing more to say here. wipes hands it's the worst part when it comes from someone you consider a friend. personally, i'd expect friends to know how shit the world is and not give arrogant, vague and or obvious advice. why does everyone do this nowadays? why is it so hard for you to just shut up and listen to what someone has to say? no one does that. ever.
i feel like i can't come out of isolation because i have nothing to show for it no friends accomplishments etc. just been living the past few years in isolation. i have a deep sense of shame about this and i finally feel like i want to come out and like, be a person again. but the thought of meeting new people who didn't waste years in isolation makes me queasy. making friends when you have none just feels downright embarrassing. reconnecting with people i lost touch with years ago due to this lovely pd is also mortifying. sorry i stopped talking to you, i took a break from being a person for a few years isn't really something i feel comfortable admitting. how do i explain myself without scaring off everyone? what if i do engage with the world again, have a good thing going for a while, and then just shut down again, only this time with a new batch of people to disappoint when i inevitably ghost them. so i do nothing. the cycle continues.
i'm your schizoid neighbour, hi! i don't know what's like in here but on r schizoid avpd is discussed very often. all sorts of questions and discussions because we avoid people as well but for another reason, so we always have someone asking if they are schizoid or avpd and what the differences are. anyways, i was very curious to come check you all and i'd like to know this, nothing complex what's your favorite hobby? plus do you you feel like you would have different hobbies if you didn't avoid people? if so, what would you love to do? share your dreams! i go first i can spend an entire day just looking at a wall, i don't have hobbies. my schizo side doesn't stop at my schizoid personality, so i can't speak for the entire schizoid sub, but if you check there you'll see that we don't like much stuff music is almost an unanimity, but besides that... you won't find much, so i'm always curious to know what people likes, it fascinates me.
feeling i don't belong when i'm alone or doing my own thing, i don't feel alone so much. i'm used to being alone and doing my own thing, and here and there i communicate with people. that's okay. but when i'm suppised to be part of a group, i start to feel inferior to others and that i don't belong. everyone else is interacting with each other but somehow i am left outside the group. the school and uni were propably the worst, because you are alone amongst everybody else everyday. in my current work everything is okay, because i work from home and i don't see the others interacting all the time. i just pretend that everyone else is doing their work alone, same as me. but. now we have this group work at my work and now i feel alone again. we should be interacting with each other, but i'm not interacting with anyone. in meetings i hear how everyone else has been working with each other, except for me.. group work makes me feel so alone
i'm just very lost and exhausted, so here's a little about my situation i struggle with extreme avpd, i've been to therapy for 8 years, with many different people. and i just feel like i'm sinking lower and lower as time goes by. it has gone too far and now i'm in a situation where i struggle to even open the front door or open my mouth to speak. i've lost the few friends i had years ago cause of the severe anxiety i felt and the panic attacks i had after meeting them. i live with my dad but i rarely talk to him cause even that is too hard for me. i studder opon my words and feel like i can't even have a regular conversation with my own parents without the severe stress i feel. i feel so hopeless and fragile. all i wanna do is keep caging myself inside my room with my distractions. but i'm also incredibly unbearably lonely and ache for genuine human connection. but i know i'd never be able to have that in the near future, if ever.
being avoidant and the pandemic i don t know what it was about the pandemic that hit me but it hit me hard, and i still find myself stuck in so many ways. i was never so scared in my life. i became agoraphobic and couldn t leave my house. i became obsessed with the news and the statistics. for someone who has been suicidal practically my whole life i was truly afraid of dying. did anyone else find yourself getting worse through this and what did you do to get past it? when i go to doctors appts they still make us wear masks and that scares me a bit still. like what do they know that we don t? i m sure i m overthinking things like i do with everything else. my daughter is anti vaxx and it worries me too, i ve had them all as a precaution since my health isn t the best now. i was working in retail at the time and watched the panic from everyone in the stores and now i m on disability because i ve gotten so bad about it. it s crazy.
ok but what now? career change i am currently making a transition from being a barista and supervisor at a coffee chain to attempting becoming a baker. retail has burnt me out to my core, exacerbated my avpd, and i'm convinced making this change might help me feel more at peace in my day to day because i have more control over my social interactions at work. however, i am having a hard time maintaining contact with the bakeries i'm trying to be recognized by without running into those anxieties that lead me to putting off an email or stopping by to introduce myself for a little too long, and thusly becoming what some would consider unprofessional in my communications. would anyone have any advice to spare about how to 1 apologize for the wait and possible inconvenience 2 when and how do i advocate for myself 3 if it's likely, how can i save my professional relationships with others when i let my anxiety call too many shots?
does anybody else get overly hurt and offended when somebody comments about how quiet you are? i ve been the quiet girl my entire life and i cannot tell you how many times during school and now work i ve heard people tell me how quiet i am. one of my teachers once called me the quietest girl they d ever known and i would always get called a mute or asked if i ever talked. and i can t explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it i have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. i don t even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. i would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me there s something wrong with me over and over and it s all i can think about. i hate it. i know i m not normal, i know i m quiet, i know i don t talk much, so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that?
my friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. long story short, i felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. i didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work, so she was worried i'd procrastinate like i did in 1 semester and fail. when i said i'll probably skip again, she looked at me with so much disappointment, and said i really should stop caring about people that much . it didn't register then, but it hits me now how hurt i am from her words. it feels like i'm not doing good enough, and i probably am not. so that day i forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. but i can't get the look on her face out of my mind. to be fair to her, i said i needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. so maybe she didn't think i felt as horrible as i did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.
where to stay during summer holidays? 1 2 months europe i'm looking for some ideas or thoughts, every holiday since childhood i'm 26 now i spent in my hometown living with my parents who used to be pretty abusive. despite them now trying to do better i still think it's not healthy for me to be there for 3 months straight but idk what to do. i got no friends or relationship duh and i only finished highschool. i don't mind strangers seeing me too much, i mainly struggle with seeing someone regularly. i got few thousands saved since i never used to spend money on anything. i'm not thinking about travelling, rather renting something in nature and staying in one place for a month or two. i was thinking maybe look for an animal shelter job in my country but i doubt they'll hire me for a month, on the other hand i'm afraid i'll be completely bored. do yall have any thoughts about that or have you done sth similar?
can denying my sexuality be a cause of avpd? so few years back i got avpd diagnosis. i am now trying to get out of this rut and fix things. thing is i have avoided everything all my life, even my feelings. so its hard. one thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old, i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. i only came out once i was 19. so 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. i am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out. is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing avpd? as i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100 and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality. thats what i did when i first figured out i was gay, thinking that my then friends would bully or reject me... any other gay people here who can relate?
avpd moms and dads does anyone think their mother or father has avpd? i am pretty sure my dad has it. i see little signs here and there sometimes, and just what i've been told as well. he has a hard time finding a real job until he was 26. by real job, i don't mean anything fancy, i just mean full time, steady work. he had a hard time asking store clerks where an item was located. when i asked him how he overcame his extreme shyness , he replied that my mom bossed out it out of him. she has introverts in her family, but they can be loud, and opinionated as well. my dad will talk on the phone when necessary but would never have a 2 hour phone call just for the sake of it. there is just other signs here and there. amp x200b have you seen any signs in your mom or dad or other relatives? i know there's a genetic component and you mix that with environment and boom, you get to deal with this lovely disorder.
anyone here try making online friends? for me its difficult because everyone is more advanced than me or younger. many people are focused on careers productivity school family. i always feel like a kid compared to others when i observe or interact with people. another issue that would happen is the few people i found remotely on my level would ditch me after some months. i think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff. in theory i should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash. it is absurd to me that i have to shut out 99.x percent of the population because they are better than me or i don't share their interests.
avoiding to live up to my potential this shit is killing me sometimes. i like drawing and cooking sweets like cakes, cookies, muffins and etc. i do have some passions and i'd love to improve my skills and spend my entire time doing this. but i avoid even thinking about going to university because that immediately settles negative thoughts in my rotten brain. what if i embarrass myself yet again?if i am not immediately good at this, what's the point of all that?this is gonna be more stressful and exhausting than enjoyable..and so on and so on. i think i do have some sort of potential but i refuse to live up to it. so many obstacles and curves on this path, it feels like i am going to fail and eventuality quit at the very start. i don't know what else to say..this is so frustrating. anyone else here who's feeling same? sorry for some mistakes i might have made btw, english isn't my native language.
reading through this sub feeling like i fit in for the first time in my life i ve spent so much of my life feeling like a complete freak who doesn t fit in anywhere, it s made me avoid social situations and relationships because i m so terrified of someone realising i m not normal and hating me for it then in turn missing out on those experiances amp relationships just makes me feel even more like an outcast who shouldn t exist i ve tried on so many hats for why i feel like this social anxiety, autism, cptsd, etc etc but they never fit right and i just feel so much more shame. then i stumbled on an infographic about personality disorders, looked up this sub and everything written here felt so familiar. so much of my anxiety came from feeling like i was alone in my experiences so it s so comforting knowing all of you are here and exist somewhere in the world. i just wanted to say thank you all
i'm ashamed of myself. i met a girl online in november and we tried to hit it off. it was a sort of long distance relationship, since she lives about an hour's drive from me, not critical, but we don't have a car neither of us or days off to see eachother too often. in fact, we've never met. on new year's eve, she was attacked by a mutual acquaintance and she got bummed out and always kept apologizing when she thought she offended me. i felt so bad every time. i broke up a few days ago i dont know if you can really call it a break up since we never even met yet because i felt like garbage and i didn't want her to depend on me, since i don't even know what to do to take care of myself. i didn't even have the courage to hear her afterwards. i apologized in advance in my last message to her and archived and silenced her chat before she could even text me back. i... pat me on the back pls...
people say the most horrible things about me then wonder why i don t open up or feel comfortable to talk to them how and why would i try being friends with people who say i m an ugly, useless, f ggot with no friends? they literally make fun of how lonely i am and talk shit about me .. who in tf is going to talk to people who obviously hate them. like most people talk shit about me. when i try being nice and open they call me annoying , weird or try to take advantage of me. when i m quiet and avoidant due to constant mistreatment they say i m weird and creepy and a loser wtf do people want from me i m so ducking exhausted dealing with people. i feel like i can t trust anyone and the whole reason i don t try reaching out to people is because every time i thought i was friends with someone they talked shit about me secretly hated me.. how am i supposed to genuinely trust anyone after that?
anyone run the other way from their friends? i have always struggled making friends, developing deeper relationships, and feeling safe in friendships. once a friendship starts to develop into something deeper, i run the other way. i think i m so scared of being rejected that i reject myself before it can happen to me or catch me off guard. i think i m also paranoid that people are just being polite and no one actually likes me, especially if i pick up on any tiny clues that this might be the case. clues look like friends not texting in a while, friends not inviting me to something, hanging out with other friends without me, or just some way that i interpret their communication or tone. does anyone experience this and how do you keep from running the other way when you can t interpret if you re truly wanted as a friend or if you need to back off? do i just need to take a leap of faith?
am i missing out on life?? i have am currently in my final year of med school and am 23 right now. i haven t been in any relationships yet and am still a virgin even though all my friends are in relationships or having flings and i feel really horrible about it. 2 years ago, i was sad that i didn t even have a social life in college but luckily i found a good small group of friends, but my love life in college has just been a series of unrequited loves which has left me anxious and hurt for most of my college life. i feel major fomo and maybe that i m unlovable as a person and i sometimes make peace with that but hearing my friends have romantic or sexual experiences really makes me feel shitty again. i feel really happy for my friends and even give them advice when ask me for it although idk why they ask me lmao but i don t know what to anymore and if this will stay this way forever.
finally deactivated facebook. where i am from, everybody is on facebook. that anxiety inducing place, where i never feel safe and i feel hated, invisible and dumb. lately i've been spiralling and posted sad, angsty posts to people who don't care about me. thankfully, i got only 60 friends . facebook made me feel more alone. i'm disabled and i don't go outside and i struggle with texting. i just don't get it. i don't have the energy. i kept deleting my posts, feeling more ashamed. i need it for something that's work related and still ongoing. but enough. i don't care if everyone is there, i rather not feel like a burden and vent on reddit. having a profile with my name and face while i am utterly depressed? no thanks. it's not like i made any friends there. i really hope that my issues will be resolved and i won't go back and make a fool outta myself because no one cares.
mentally exhausted i have been very mentally exhausted. i don t mind working long hours at my job, it s just at my job there s a lot of people around since it s a large store connected to a bunch of departments. a few months since i graduated high school i ve been working. but i can t seem to really talk to people. i have a tendency to avoid the groups, sometimes i can t even open my mouth. it s even worse when i think about how much i suck, and how awful i look. i feel like an inconvenience and a burden, because plainly i am pretty stupid. even though at the beginning of my job i was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay, i can t even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless i have to. i am so exhausted. i don t know what s wrong with me. i am depressed, both mentally and physically tired. i really have no plans for my future.
do you guys try to avoid people you know, or just people you don't know? i used to be anxious about being around strangers, but now i don't really care as much. but i always get way more anxious at the thought of meeting people i do know and i try to avoid them as much as i can. i don't even see any value in forming friendships relationships anymore. i try open up as little as possible to people. the more i get to know them, the more i try to avoid them. i fear that friendships come with unrealistic expectations and that as people get to know me they'll realise that i'm weird and will gradually dislike me, and maybe try to make me feel guilty for not meeting their expectations. i also don't want to become dependent on other people, cos it seems like most 'friends' only seem to care about you when it suits them. i just think most friendships are fake and over rated.

are you a fawn? in pete walker's work there are 4 types of trauma responses. fight, flight, freeze, and the last least spoken about, fawn . fawning is just as it sounds. you fawn over people. you people please and bend to their will even if you know it's fucking you over in the long run. i feel like being a fawn has caused me to hate people even more than i should lol. because when people come around, they usually come with some bs that i don't really want anything to do with. wanting favors, wanting me to be their emotional punching bag, wanting validation, wanting talk at me, wanting me to give them stuff etc. i don't have a back bone and it's really hard for me to tell people to kick rocks without feeling guilty so it just becomes another reason why i isolate myself. nobody can drag me into their drama if nobody is there to begin with. are you like this?

natural brain dampener i have recently been experimenting with some substances and after three or more days of taking ashwagandha most of my avpd chatter ceases, it also dampens my need socialize or seek validation not that i had much of that but at least now i don't care when i run out of things to say during a conversation, before i was made uncomfortable by the thought seeming boring or long silence in conversation but with this i don't care at all. its a very subtle effect though, so i like it. i'm not going to pretend to understand how it works, and i definitely don't recommend it because there are several people who have had severe adverse effects with it, but i have found a new unintended use for it and i wanted to share this discovery. sadly as a sad effect i find myself dragging my feet to do anything, i just lose interest in almost everything.

discovering this avpd has been a massive relief. hoping to spread some positivity. i've spent so long thinking there's something wrong with me and constantly questioning why i can't just find things as easy as everyone else seems to do. why i can't just be normal? learning about social anxiety was a help but even then it was like it can't just be that though? and then thinking i must be autistic or have adhd in some regard but never really feeling like i fit into those things. to actually have a name for it and relate to so much of what people post on here, it's kind of a relief to know that there's some reason that i'm actually like this and just knowing that this is why. i won't use it as an excuse and i'm going to fight against its tendencies as much as i can, but i'm just glad that i finally understand now. i appreciate you all being here.

this is a bit of a weird question, but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? mushishi, kino's journey etc i've always wondered if this is something avpd adjacent. mushishi kino's journey spice and wolf girl's last tour serial experiments lain they are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the mcs and the rest of the world. it's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on, they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but mushishi only has the mc and that's the one that feels closest to avpd in a weird way in my mind. does this make sense?

some individuals with personality disorders experience a sense of identity crisis. they might have difficulty defining who they are, their role in the world, and their place in relationships. these challenges could manifest in various ways. for example, someone with a borderline personality disorder might express feelings of identity crisis by frequently changing their personal interests, hobbies, or roles. they might also have a longing for validation and acceptance from others, leading them to adapt their identity to fit in with different social circles or based on the approval of certain individuals. another way identity crisis may manifest is through intense mood swings or emotional instability. an individual with a personality disorder may have conflicting feelings about their identity or see themselves from multiple perspectives

be poetic yet precise. a fractured mind, a chaotic dance, emotions uncontained, no chance of reprieve, a relentless maze, a mirror of past pains, a labyrinth to amaze. whispers of fear and loss concealed, in shadows of despair, pain s wielder revealed, a waltz of anger, love and pain, echoes through memories that never wane. but even amidst the inner tumult, a glimmer of hope, no matter how small, promises the strength, the resilience of soul, to face, to endure, another day
my reflection in the tarnished mirror reveals a stranger, her eyes pleading with my own for a flicker of familiarity. my name, my memories...all fragments slipping through my grasp like sand. who am i supposed to be? whose emotions surge through me, threatening to consume the last vestiges of self? is this who i choose to be, or have i allowed myself to be swept away by the tides of someone else's chaos? the answer remains as elusive as my reflection in the shimmering pool.

the chaos inside swirls, tempests of emotion collide. whispers of dissociation weave through my mind. the mirror reflects an empty vessel as feelings tangle and thoughts distort and dissent. barely contained this raging symphony. the world outside a distant canvas of grey. beneath turmoil and tumult, a soul seeks escape. yet resilience persists, a flickering ember of hope. as shattered pieces meld together, whole, birthed from the depths the artist's unquenchable soul.

consider themes of loneliness, doubt, or vulnerability. i stare at my reflection in the mirror, the girl looking back a foreign stranger. her smile, once bright and infectious, now an enigma i can't unravel. am i enough? can i trust these emotions that seem to ebb and flow like an uncertain tide? my heart aches with the weight of a thousand unsaid words, leaving me adrift in a sea of doubt. and in that solitude, i'm haunted by the ghost of a happiness that eludes me.

personality disorders can have a profound impact on one's emotional wellbeing, creating a turbulent inner emotional landscape. imagery, such as stormy weather, can help to convey the sense of being tossed about by uncontrollable emotions and impulses. here's an attempt my mind, a raging sea, tempestuous and unyielding, with waves of emotion crashing against my shores, leaving me battered and bruised, never at peace, my soul in a perpetual state of tumult and unrest.

what is it like for me having apd? for me, having apd is like dying in slow motion. you just watch all these years go by, one after another, as you unwillingly stay alone and sabotage your relationship potential with others. it's like standing stationary on a train station platform, and just watching the trains of life pass you by, year after year, but you are too terrified to ever get into any of the trains. anyone else feels the same? that's how i can describe it

communication when you have avpd, you avoid forming relationships, ight?therefore most of us prefer living like hermits. the point i am trying to make is, is there anyone else who notice that they can't carry even simplest chit chats?when someone tries to talk to me and asks anything, i try my best to come up with an answer but it feels like there is some sort of static in my head, the white noise. i guess it's because i heavily prefer my fantasies over real life

imagine standing at the edge of a turbulent, stormy sea. waves of unpredictable emotions crash over you, leaving you soaked and disheveled. yet, there's an unseen tide pulling you further into the unknown, a personality beyond your grasp. your heart clings to stability, but the whirlpools of your mind threaten to drown you. amidst the relentless surge, a glimmer of resilience ignites, fighting to swim against the tide towards understanding and self discovery.
am i the only who doesn't give a shit about the current thing? i always have to somehow hear about whatever the hottest new topic is, be it politics, tech, music, media scandals, etc. and it is excruciatingly stressful to pretend to be interested in it whenever someone asks about it. okay, i'm kidding, no one asks me anything about anything, cuz i don't talk to people. but seriously, i see it all the time and everyone has to respond to it. it's exhausting...

failing to understand the true logic behind social interactions and relationships. until i started reading about psychology and watching videos about it, i don't think i understood myself or other people thoroughly. i wish i had done this 20 years ago. because, well, school doesn't teach you this and my parents didn't teach me this at all. they provided but they didn't truly parent me. they were mainly focused on their own emotional needs without knowing it.
remember the disorder can vary and create different experiences for everyone. gripped by an intense whirlwind of emotions, torn between love and hate, fear and desire, loss and hope, elation and agony. drowning in a chaotic symphony of disordered thoughts, memories, and senses, every heartbeat a struggle for survival, every breath an act of resistance, i grasp at meaning amidst the storm, clinging to the shreds of self, lost amidst the labyrinth of my mind.
it doesn't have to be a whole monologue or a lengthy passage, just a moment of introspection. my reflection in the mirror returns a face unfamiliar, a jumble of features that don't match the person i used to be. how did i get here, shedding the comfort of my own skin like an unwanted serpent, leaving behind a trail of uncertainty in its wake? i must find a way to recognize myself amidst the storms of emotion raging within, or risk losing all sense of self.
job so i got a job and i m super anxious and can t stop crying. i start on tuesday or wednesday, and i'm already nervous for that day to come. i feel a huge fear, can't quite point out what the fear is but something of it is probably the social interaction. i wish something terrible happens to me so i can avoid the first day of work. what should i do? i really want to ghost the man boss , and just wanna stay home. but my family really wants me to get a job

they find comfort in an article they ve come across. as i sifted through the fragments of my shattered self, my fingers lingered on a link to an article titled the power of identities redefining who we are. each word seemed to be inscribed with a balm to soothe my restless mind, whispering that maybe, just maybe, there was a way to patch together the jagged pieces of my identity and claim a self understanding that isn't confined to my fleeting emotions.
1. i'm a chameleon, constantly changing to fit in, but deep down, who am i really? 2. my emotions are like a rollercoaster, one minute i'm elated, the next i'm despairing, who's the real me? 3. i'm a living contradiction, longing for stability yet craving adventure, who do i truly represent? 4. i'm a puzzle, a jigsaw with missing pieces, trying to figure out who i'm meant to be. 5. i'm a labyrinth, lost in my own maze, seeking the heart of my identity.
is it common for people with avpd to have a specific preference in friendship and to feel more comfortable around a certain type of people? i know that not all people with avpd have friends or want friends. for those who made friends in the past or want to make friends with others, do they or you have a preference in people they you feel more comfortable with being around and with being becoming friends with them? what did those people have in common?
this person finds solace in listening to music or in nature but continues to feel lost within themselves and uncertain of their place in the world. i close my eyes and let the soothing melody envelop me, my only refuge from the relentless tempest of emotions boiling within. but even amidst the gentle symphony of the leaves or the rhythmic beats of the earth beneath my feet, my heart remains shackled by an uncertain future and a clouded sense of self.
1. my emotions are a rollercoaster, and i can't seem to find my footing in this identity crisis. 2. i present a mask to the world, but inside, i'm a jumbled mess of insecurities and self doubt. 3. i'm a chameleon, constantly adapting to fit in, but who am i when i'm not trying to please others? 4. i'm like a leaf in the wind, carried away by the emotions i can't control. 5. i long for stability, but my identity feels as fragile as glass. 6. i'm torn

1. who am i, if not the sum of my moods and conflicting desires? 2. my emotions are a rollercoaster, and i'm the only one with a ticket. 3. i'm a chameleon, constantly adapting to fit in, but who am i when i'm alone? 4. i'm a puzzle with missing pieces, and i'm searching for the ones that complete me. 5. my identity feels as fragile as a glass figurine, easily shattered by the slightest breeze of doubt. 6. i'm a kaleidoscope of emotions, and i can't
inside my mind, i'm a battleground of emotions and insecurities, unsure of who i truly am or where i belong. some days i'm courageous and assertive, other days timid and fearful. i crave stability, but my own identity eludes me like a slippery fish, evading my grasp just when i think i have it mastered. the mirrors of my soul are clouded, obscuring my reflection, leaving me questioning if this mosaic of feelings is even worthy of love or acceptance.
people get frustrated by me do people get frustrated by you? i don't know why, but i detect frustration when i'm around others. sometimes i just want to move far away and start a new life. i just want to get away from it all and disappear. they don't accept me, and so i just feel like i'm better off alone for eternity. i want to live on a remote island. people just judge me for the way that i am, and i hate it. i don't know why they hate me so much.
use metaphor, emotion, and detail, but keep it concise. a kaleidoscope swirls within, shattering fragments of self, splintering the mirror of identity. an insidious masquerade. tendrils of grief snake through veins, as memories seep like poison into consciousness. whirlpools of anger churn beneath, threatening to drown dreams in their vortex. regrets, regrets, each a razor in the heart's soft tissue, ripping, tearing, leaving an inky stain on hope.
the hole i'm in is deep, not sure i can get out i've always had a good amount of self awareness but with that, i can see the depth of problems. i know the minimum depth and it is already potentially too much. my ability to change is not as much now, my brain is not set up for normal life. i've become institutionalized. i'm past 30yo, i can't relate to average people, i'm cynical of most, and the ones i'm not cynical of want nothing to do with me.
perhaps it's a line of dialogue, or an introspective moment from a character's perspective. as the fragments of my identity swirl around in a tumultuous storm, i cling to the shreds of stability, praying they'll coalesce into something whole. yet each fleeting sense of self is just another mirror reflecting a distorted and contradictory image, a labyrinthine maze where every path leads to a dead end, and no matter how hard i try, i'm always lost.
write it as a poem to add depth and richness to the text. in shattered pieces i weave a tale, a dance of light with shadows dark, beneath the weight, i bear with flail, heart woven 'gainst life's intricate lark. an endless sea where feelings drift, upon the tide of ebb and tide, the sun kissed shore of joy uplift, contrast'd by fear's abyss, sunk so deep, wide. waters once serene with love adorned, ripple and wave in chaos's thrall, moments where
use metaphor. the tempest in my soul churns unabated, a ceaseless dance of sorrow, fear, and doubt, a relentless storm of darkest shades, eroding reason, drowning sanity's vowed. each gust of wind, a new emotion torn, an amalgamation of love lost and won, yet with each drop, the pain, my heart s own scorn, begins anew and never, ne'er is one. but with this turmoil brews the faintest glimmer, a fleeting calm, a moment s peaceful breath, as from
i should be the one dead instead life is truly a joke 27 m meet here my life ended 4 years ago after i graduated , i turned to a neet and became a burden for my parents and family .all i want is to diiiie . an old friend i knew before had his life together, went abroad abroad after graduatiion, studied and got a high paying job, after that an accident and boom he is dead. i feel i should be in his place , i am sure his family won't mind that.
beneath the veneer of a functioning adult, my mind was a tempestuous ocean, its waves of anxiety and insecurity colliding, threatened to drown me. each day felt like a treacherous tightrope walk, one misstep leading to the dark abyss of my deepest fears and insecurities. yet, i clung to the rope, hoping against hope that i could muster the courage and resilience to weather the storm and reach the calm waters of self acceptance and stability.
sometimes i feel like avpd is my entire identity i have to find a way to overcome this, because it's not working. i feel like my identity in this world is shy, introverted, loner. when i try to break the mold of both what i and other people view me as, i lowkey have an identity crisis. i think this is why i keep sabotaging my efforts to change, because i feel like avpd and being a sad sack of trauma is my identity and my place in this world.
this thought should not be overtly optimistic, and should suggest a feeling of sadness, confusion or unease. as i stare into the mirror, i can't help but wonder who i truly am beneath the surface of my chaotic emotions and fragmented identity. is this person real, or just a complex patchwork of fractured pieces i've stitched together? my reflection seems to mock me, reminding me of the person i want to be, but fear i may never truly become.
in the depths of my twisted, kaleidoscopic mind, identities battle for dominance, fragmented memories haunt me like an old ghost. each emotion a stormcloud, brewing in silence, waiting to release its wrath upon an unsuspecting heart. a whirlwind of self loathing, guilt, and shame crashes in, leaving the fragile remnants of the once stable, consistent me. an eternal sea of pain and torment, drowned by the ebb and flow of my disordered soul.

1. i'm a chameleon, constantly adapting to fit in, but who am i truly? 2. my emotions are a pendulum, swinging wildly, leaving me feeling lost and disconnected. 3. i'm a puzzle with missing pieces, yearning for self understanding. 4. who i present to the world is a facade, hiding the chaos within. 5. i'm a leaf on the wind, carried by the whims of my emotions. 6. i'm a labyrinth, lost in the maze of my own identity. 7. i'm a chameleon

accountability post i really want to go to church. so bad. i have good memories of singing songs that lifted my spirit, and developing friendships with people both humble and gracious. but every week, i don't go. this week, if i can make it to the parking lot, i am rewarding myself with doughnuts. i am sorry if this is annoying, but i am struggling so much to do something that is important to me and i have not gone in 3 years.
in the shimmering mirror of my soul, reflections of me shatter and reform a kaleidoscope of identities dazzling yet disjointed. i am a patchwork quilt of emotions, fragments of a whole, woven together by shredded strands of self. echoes of past hurt and forgotten pieces mingle, weaving a tapestry of pain and confusion. a tempest within, unpredictable and relentless, i am a human storm, an uninvited guest to the dance of life.

a single line, or a phrase will be perfect. every smile masked, every wave concealed, beneath lies a storm of conflicting selves. personality disorder. unknown this quote illustrates the external appearance of calm and normalcy, but the turmoil hidden deep within, creating a dichotomy between the inner and outer self. it's a constant balancing act to hide the emotional turbulence and present a presentable self to the world.

i was a garden in my mother's care, blooming in the sun, my petals delicate and soft. but then one day a cold winter came and she, in her anger and ineptitude, shattered me. each fragment resembling her other broken children. i'm now a pile of scattered pieces, longing for that glorious sun once more, but unsure if i could bear its warmth again. fractured, damaged, but still yearning for the beauty that once was my home.

avpd among avpds do you feel that you'll be alienated even here, among people that have same feelings ? i bet they hate it, so i won't post anything , i can't figure out how to make a good comment, so if i do, they'll think i'm stupid , should i show same reaction, to fit it , i'm not diagnosed, so i think my experience isn't worth of sharing . hiding your true self even here. same society, same rules, same reaction.
my face looks younger than its 39 years, and i think it s because i ve worked my whole life to keep it as expressionless as possible, and not reveal all the turbulent and contradictory feelings underneath. as a kid i was often mistaken as mature beyond my years. at least i don t have to worry about smile lines. through self conscious terror, i ve managed to suppress any impulse to have a spontaneous social reaction.

what's the point? i literally don't see a reason to continue living like this. i have no friends. i'm incapable of forming any meaningful relationships. i lack the ability to function in society successfully. i have no long term goals. i'm a burden and disappointment to my family. i live in a perpetual state of guilt and fear. the only time i'm vaguely happy is when i'm drunk, but i know that's not sustainable.

how to deal with rejection when you have avpd? i feel like i'm dying, like there's a hole in my chest and thoughts make me feel like i'm falling in. i'm also having very negative thoughts, i'm realising i'm angry at myself for being vulnerable enough for this to happen to me. please help if you've been through this...i see no hope. p.s i mean rejected after asking a girl out i've been talking to for months.
am i doomed? i recently got diagnosed with avpd and i feel completely hopeless. this is me, and i will stay like this my whole life. am i going to have girlfriends? am i going to get my dream job? have a fun life? travel around the world? apparently not. apparently i'm just a guy who will stay in his room for the rest of his life and be perpetually awkward at social gatherings. i'm 22 and i feel like i'm 60
avpd and social anxiety on the rise? it feels like avpd and social anxiety are becoming more prevalent especially younger generations and that this was exacerbated by the pandemic. even before the pandemic it was an issue with the use of social media fueling a rise in mental health issues, but the isolation of the pandemic obviously made things worse. maybe avpd will become more mainstream in a few years?
can't get anything done not sure if anyone else relates, but i'm struggling to start or finish anything. i'm incredibly behind in my work, and i don't do any hobbies or spend much time at the gym either. i'm also pretty ashamed of myself, which leads me to avoid people. it's not a good circle to be stuck in. i've had ideas for things to try, but it's pretty hard to start anything. does anyone else relate?
in this moment, they feel unsure of who they truly are and how they should act in response to a given situation. internal monologue how can i trust my emotions when they shift like the tides, betraying me just as frequently? am i the sum of these conflicting feelings, or is there a stable, unchanging core at my center? these questions loop endlessly through my thoughts, leaving me anchored in uncertainty.
dae just not imagine themselves being around after a certain age? in my head i never think i'm going to make x years of age 30 for example and it's not because i specifically plan to do anything but i just kind of think i'll probably be far too fed up of this misery at that point and end it ...and then that milestone age will come and it'll then change to the next one that i can't imagine making it past.
it could be a single line or a paragraph. beneath the shimmering exterior, an emotional storm brews. torrential waves of shame and regret clash violently against islands of anxiety and fear, leaving chaos in their wake. invisible wounds carve a tumultuous dance floor for inner demons, as a fractured identity tries to tango with the echoes of past selves, caught in an endless carousel of self destruction.
how this struggle could have been impacting their relationships and interactions with others inner thought i can t seem to grasp who i truly am. the constant fluctuation of emotions leaves me feeling lost and confused, unable to maintain genuine connections with others. the uncertainty gnaws at my relationships, leaving a bittersweet sense of loneliness that only further amplifies the emptiness within.
the rare occasion where i decide to speak up, i end up saying something stupid and retreat back into my comfort zone frustratingly it takes time for me to get back out. i keep thinking how dumb it was for me to even bother trying when i should ve stayed quiet like usual. it s annoying because when it comes to social situations, i pretty much never forget things so i can end up dwelling on things a lot.
internal thought as i stare into the mirror, my reflection blurring the lines between who i am and who i want to be, i can't help but feel a sense of displacement and unease. my emotions flutter like a wounded bird trapped inside me, seeking escape but never quite finding the right direction. i wonder if i'll ever be able to reconcile these conflicting aspects of myself and find a sense of inner peace.
i want to do a job that requires social skills i do not have great social skills. i am awkward and shy. but i saw an ad for a job that helps adults with disabilities find and maintain employment. i want to apply for it but it requires making connections with business owners and having good interpersonal skills. this is just a vent about wanting things that are outside the realm of being a good idea...
no interest in life does anyone else have zero interest in life? i'm kind of done, but assisted suicide has been delayed another year in canada. who knew killing yourself was so difficult . i'm not necessarily sad about dying, but life is kind of pointless in my eyes. i'm too much of a coward and squeamish to do it any other way. i wish i could travel and do it abroad, but i can't leave at the moment.
who am i without my mood swings and contradictory thoughts? am i the person i want to be or the one others see? this thought expresses the internal conflict of someone struggling with identity issues and unstable emotions. they're questioning who they truly are beneath their emotional instability and whether their perceived identity aligns with their true self or the way they're perceived by others.
the person's thoughts should center around feeling misunderstood and the fear of judgment. i wish they could see the turmoil brewing beneath this calm exterior, the storm of emotions that often overwhelms me. but they don't, they only see the version of me that i carefully present to the world orderly, predictable, reliable. how can i trust them to understand when i can't even make sense of it all?
now that i think about it, everytime ive become suicidal is because of other people my self confidence could not be any lower after years of rejection and not fitting in anywhere. i now realise if i just dont get involved with people ill be ok. its always been one step foward two steps back when i try to intergrate. can't be rejected and hurt if im on my own and thats starting to seem fine to me.
i can't trust myself or the way i think and feel each day brings new twists to the unpredictable roller coaster ride of emotions that is my life. every time i feel a sense of clarity or stability, i'm blindsided by an unexpected burst of sadness or anxiety. i'm tired of constantly trying to decipher who i am and what i want it feels like a never ending labyrinth that keeps leading me in circles.
alameda by elliott smith and avpd i m not saying elliott had avpd, but as an avpd sufferer i feel like the lyrics in this songs fits to a lot of what s going on in my life. i m constantly guarding myself against other people s love your protection over their affection , and basically alienating myself from them nobody broke your heart. you broke your own, cause you can t finish what you start .
as i stare into the mirror, my reflection morphs and twists, as if the person looking back at me is not really me, but an illusion, a facade of a person i'm trying to become. i cling to the threads of my identity, but they seem to slip through my fingers like sand. my emotions are as unstable as the tides, shifting and swirling, threatening to pull me under, leaving me feeling adrift and lost.
socializing in public has the same feeling of walking into an employee only area in stores i'm sure you've seen those doors with the warning signs that say it's not meant for customers at establishments. socializing with avpd feels i'm walking into one of those employee only areas. that same sense of urgency knowing that i don't belong there and i need to get out before something bad happens..
not afraid of rejections but about others mocking me for my feelings can anybody relate? i dont think i am afraid of the rejection but about two other things first one is that other guys could mock me for my feelings and use this against me. and second is that if she does get to know me better she might loose interest as i am just not really good at this dating thing. can you relate to that?
aim for approximately 10 words. lost in a maze of fragmented identity, i seek stability, yet fear the loss of change. this thought reflects the inner struggle of personality disorder, where one experiences both a longing for stability and a fear of losing the flexibility that comes with personality traits. it highlights the emotional complexity and contradiction inherent in this condition.
valentines i don t normally get sad around valentines because i never really expected to have a relationship. but i guess because of getting some help from my therapist, my emotions around not dating etc. have been stirred up. sick of how normal it is for other people to date when it s so hard for me. anyways, just wanted to say even if it s a bad day for you happy early valentine s day
i can't trust my own feelings or thoughts, they're as unpredictable as the weather. alternatively, you could say who am i, really? one moment i feel confident and capable, the next i'm consumed by self doubt and insecurity. or, if you'd like a more introspective take i long for a sense of self, but my emotions shift like sand through my fingers, leaving me feeling lost and unanchored.
i used to think i was just a confused millennial, unsure of where i fit in this ever changing world. but now, i'm starting to believe there's something deeper, a chasm within me that can't be filled. these unpredictable emotions that wash over me don't seem normal. i fear i'm lost in the labyrinth of my own mind, yearning for a sense of stability and purpose that i can't quite grasp.
do people get upset at you because you used to talk to them a lot then you stop talking to them? i talk to a lot of people sometimes then i get really exhausted and can t keep up. then i don t want to talk to many people anymore. the people i end up not talking to anymore, some get really upset at me for not talking to me anymore, but they don t tell me, so how am i supposed to know?
1. who am i, really? sometimes i feel like a chameleon, adapting to fit different situations and personas. but deep down, i'm terrified that there's no authentic self to begin with. 2. my emotions are like a rollercoaster, and i'm the only one who can't seem to get off. one minute i'm elated, the next i'm despairing, and i'm left wondering if i'll ever find stability within myself.
avpd got a shout out in the expendables kind of a funny bit of trivia, i didn't expect to hear avpd mentioned in a very 'manly man' action movie like the expendables, but at one point randy couture's character mentions he is going to therapy for it lol. he says it at the 18 second mark in this clip. https www.youtube.com watch?v ikmkgbtvfv8 https www.youtube.com watch?v ikmkgbtvfv8
does exposure therapy work for avpd? does exposure therapy or testing your fears work for avpd? my therapist is pushing me into exposure therapy. i think i do have mild form of avpd since it does effect me, i have anxiety issues and depression but it doesn't always keep me from doing something. i try to get around it most times but when i have to, i do it even though i feel anxious
group therapy is it a good idea? i've been asked to self refer to a network of group therapy, i think it will be a good way to meet others who have this disorder but at the same time i am terrified, especially about speaking publicly and opening up to a group of people, has any here ever tried it or are you currently in a group therapy? i'd love to hear your experiences. thank you.

in this moment of reflection, i'm lost among the kaleidoscope of my own mind, each piece of my shattered identity scattering like broken glass, and i'm unable to grasp onto a single fragment that feels authentically mine. my emotions seem to ebb and flow with the unpredictability of the tides, leaving me uncertain of who i truly am and how to navigate the tempestuous seas within.
something like in the labyrinthine depths of my psyche, fragments of shattered identity vie for dominance, each clinging tenaciously to its piece of the self, rendering cohesive thought an insurmountable challenge. yet, amidst the relentless turmoil, flickers of resilience glimmer, as i grapple to unite the shattered fragments, seeking a fragile semblance of unity, of wholeness.
as i stare at my reflection in the mirror, my mind is a swirling tornado of contradictions am i the bright and ambitious woman i pretend to be, or the uncertain and fearful person beneath the surface? the chasm between my desired identity and my true nature grows wider with each passing day, leaving me suspended between the person i want to be and the one i am unable to shake.
i m tired of this endless internal turmoil, but who am i without it? who would i be if i could just accept myself, without the constant questioning and doubts? maybe it s better to stay lost in the fog, than to risk being disappointed yet again by the reflection in the mirror. optional for more prompts, visit https magpiefable.wordpress.com and explore writephoto challenge
person who am i, if not the sum of my most volatile emotions? explanation in this thought, the person is questioning their identity based on their unstable emotions. they may feel that their emotions define them, and that these emotions are inconsistent or unpredictable. this can lead to feelings of confusion and instability, as they struggle to define who they truly are.
here is my thought the masks i wear, the complex web of emotions within, the endless fight for control, the fear of rejection, the constant battle of insecurities and self doubt, the overwhelming sadness that lurks beneath the surface, the intense shame that consumes me this is the chaos and confusion of my mind, this is the turmoil of living with a personality disorder.
i'm not the friend people want. i'm not great at connecting with people. i understand social cues but i guess people find me weird or whatever. i will be there for people but they will say things like they feel like they have nobdoy to talk to and it makes me feel like i'm not good enough for them or the the type of friend they had in mind. it sucks but what can you do?
how they wish things could just be simpler. internally, she longed for a stable sense of self, free from the whirlwind of unpredictable emotions that constantly cluttered her mind. if only life could be as clear cut and linear as a straight line on a graph. but no, even that simplicity was too much to ask for in this convoluted tapestry of self discovery and confusion.
i think i made a mistake so, a couple of days ago i opened up about my anxiety and all the mental struggles i deal with, to a friend. now i feel like i over shared and feel guilty by doing so. i feel vulnerable whenever i am with him like i can't hide behind a mask. it feels so scary when you feel like they will also leave you eventually because they see the real you.
they might be trying to come to terms with a recent self revelation or something else that is causing turmoil in their heart. as i stare into the mirror, i can t help but question the person looking back at me. who am i, really? my emotions fluctuate like the tides, leaving me unsure of my true nature. i fear the answer may be as elusive as the reflection before me.
i long to be a stable, consistent version of myself, yet the mirror reflects a ever changing tapestry of emotions and beliefs. i've also included an example of a response from a supportive friend friend it's okay to feel uncertain and fluid, my friend. emotions are a part of who we are and they change as we grow and learn. you are more than the sum of your feelings.
my reflection stares back at me, an unfamiliar stranger, as i struggle to recognize the person within. congratulations on your thought! here's a brief response i see you, lost in the mirror, searching for the echo of a self long forgotten. may you find solace in embracing the complexity of your identity, and may your emotions stabilize with time and self compassion.
identity crisis why must the world confuse me so? every feature of me fluctuates like a volatile wave, yet others perceive a solid rock. who am i truly? am i even real, or merely an illusion of myself? an intricate puzzle, with none of the pieces staying still. perhaps when they fit, i'll become complete. in time, i'll find harmony within this kaleidoscope of being.
internal thought i'm a chameleon, adapting to fit in every situation, but who am i truly? if you want to make it more relatable to your character, you can adjust it to fit their specific personality or experiences. for example, i wear masks to hide my true self, but which one is the real me? or i'm a puzzle with missing pieces, searching for the identity i've lost.
do you have goals? i realised that i never really had or was aware of life goals or dreams i had. i think this is why i don't really feel like a person and so different from others. and why i never let anyone get close to me, otherwise they would realise how different i am and distance themselves. do you have dreams and goals? have you ever had them, maybe as kids?
the thought should express a feeling of fragmentation and inconsistency. who am i today? yesterday's self shatters as new fragments form, each one reflecting a piece of me i didn't know existed. i'm a patchwork of feelings and thoughts, a storm within myself. i can't trust the reflection in the mirror, as it may mirror a completely different version of me tomorrow.
do others know about your situation? none of my family knows that i m lonely and struggle talking to people. they do ask me how i ve been and how university is going, but i always insist things are going fine and that i ve made friends. i wish it didn t come to me lying to them, but i guess that s better than them being worried sick at the reality of the way i am.
i am no longer afraid of ghosts since i get avpd i went out to throw garbage in the middle of the night today, it was dark outside, and there was no one there, and i was not scared at all. i might have been scared in the past, but now i hope that some ghost will appear to accompany me, because i really is it too afraid of humans and too lonely, is there the same?
being uncomfortable with personal compliments a friend complimented me, saying i have a good conversation, i'm handsome, etc. i mean, didn't attack me at all the opposite, actually so why does some sort of fight flight state come over me with situations like this? to me, it really doesn't make sense. unfortunately, it's how i function. i have to get used to this.
interior monologue i m such a puzzle, an intricate web of emotions and desires. one minute, i m the confident, driven woman i want to be the next, i m a quivering wreck, unable to cope with the slightest pressure. i can t trust myself, let alone the reflection staring back at me in the mirror. who am i, really? an ever changing amalgamation of dreams and doubts?
avpd is neglected disorder so there are beliefs that avpd is caused by neglect of parents or caretakers. and then when you grow up you realize you have this and even this disorder itself is neglected. so individuals having this disorder are basically neglected in every way for their entire life. from parents neglecting them, to society neglecting their disorder.
people have tendency telling me their mental health problems there were few people who i just get to know and they almost instantly were like i have this mental illness disorder that i am stalking people i know , i was thinking like oh, okay, thanks for telling me . i don t know why people do that, do i look like some mental health professional or psychiatrist?
internal monologue who am i, really? one moment i feel confident and capable, the next i'm a mess of insecurities and self doubt. i long for stability, yet my emotions seem to be in a constant state of flux. i'm torn between wanting to hide away from the world and craving connection with others. how can i be authentic when i can't even figure out who that is?
internal monologue am i the shell of my former self, or am i merely a chameleon, shape shifting to fit into different personas? each moment is a labyrinth of self doubt and conflicting emotions. which is the true me? which facade should i don today? the thought is a heavy burden, threatening to drag me under, drowning in the swirling tide of identity crisis.
avpd getting worse over time? ive been noticing my symptoms increasing. its getting to the point i cant hold conversations with anyone but my wife without becoming suicidal. its been getting worse each week. is this normal? feburary is usually the hardest month of the year for me, so that might be a factor, but god is it going to continue like this forever?
anyone feeling the same? i'm in my late 20s , when i see people younger than me enjoying their lives i feel deep sadness inside. i really wished i could have had what they had , being young , having friends, partners doing activities... i wish i didn't choose to miss out on crucial years of my life listening to my depression and fucked up thinking patterns.
within the labyrinth of my mind, thoughts and feelings entangle, a chaotic dance between the real and imagined. at times an inferno of emotions, searing passions, and insatiable cravings, at others a hollow void, vacant of meaning and reason. am i a storm or a quiet pond? a puzzle waiting to be solved, or the unwritten chapters of a forever changing novel?
what are your waking habits like? i try to be an early bird and probably feel a bit more human when i am but it's definitely more natural for me to be awake in the early hours of the morning and wake up later in the day. thought it was worth asking to see whether most are night owls in an attempt to avoid life? view poll https www.reddit.com poll 11y8hsd
internal monologue i used to know who i was, but now every glance in the mirror reveals a different reflection a mirage of ambiguous features and fluctuating emotions. sometimes i feel like a leaf blowing in the wind, vulnerable to the whims of each passing gust. my sense of self crumbles with each breath, as elusive as a wisp of smoke who am i, really?
as i gaze into the mirror, i am a kaleidoscope of emotions the reflected image is an enigma i can t comprehend. fragile pieces of self woven together by insecurity and confusion, threatening to unravel at the slightest provocation. each day i search for a steady identity, but my reflection reveals only elusive fragments, forever slippery and intangible.
i'm desperate, i don't know how to turn things around i know i should get my shit together, but to be honest i am too much of a coward to do so. i thought maybe with age i will try to turn things around out of desperation, but despair made things even worse , i feel more paralyzed than ever. in fact i wish i had some incurable disease. i want to die...
avpd and autism last year i was diagnosed with avpd by a psychiatrist. today i was diagnosed as autistic after a 1.5 year process of multiple assessments culminating in a 3 hour assessment today with 2 clinic psychiatrists and an autism nurse. now i don't know if i am just autistic or if i have avpd too. wondered if anyone here has had both diagnoses?
i used to know who i was, but now my reflection in the mirror is a blur of contradictions. my emotions teeter on the precipice of stability, but one wrong move can send me spiraling into an abyss of confusion and despair. i long for a sense of self, a grounding in who i truly am, but each new discovery feels like another puzzle piece lost in the wind.
my reflection stares back at me, a stranger in my own skin. the person i thought i was, the person i wanted to be, seems to be fading, replaced by a constantly shifting, unstable being. i can't keep up with my own emotions, and the thought of forming a connection with someone terrifies me what if they see the real me, the one i can't even recognize?
the thought doesn t need to be complete or grammatically correct, just a glimpse into the character s inner world. my mind is a battleground, a swirling pit of conflict and turmoil. who am i, truly? one moment, i m confident and bold, the next, an insecure mess. the person i present to the world is a carefully crafted mask, hiding the chaos beneath.
here i go. im trying to find out my feelings another day. at my core i feel gone like something was never placed there. im 28 years old. i will try to explain it as numb or not there. i dont feel like there is something on the inside of my mind. looking for people who relate or any support. do you think it has a name, its not really depression imo.
i long to be anchored in my self, yet each wave of emotion threatens to carry me away, leaving me lost in the depths of uncertainty. my reflection shimmers like a mirage, unclear and ever changing. who am i beneath these fickle emotions? can i trust the face i see in the mirror, or is it just another mask, ready to slip away and conceal the truth?
don t make it a long passage. as i gazed into the mirror, my reflection distorted, i couldn t help but question the accuracy of the person staring back at me. was this the real me, or a complex facade formed from societal expectations and hidden insecurities? my emotions, like shifting sand, offered no solid ground upon which to build my identity.
as i stand before the mirror, the reflections of the endless shards of my fractured identity flicker and fade like candles in the wind, i question who i am, or rather, whose i am. am i just a composition of the shifting moods and the ever changing landscape of the world around me, or am i a being capable of holding on to a true and lasting self?
how common is it to develop aggression as a pw avpd as a way to cope with the fear? starting to learn more about avpd. people talk about the fight or flight reaction and i myself have experienced it where i thought i either have to fight or run away but i was wondering if pw avpd ever experience this and hence grow up to be somewhat antisocial?
who else can't let go? of anything. of something that you told yourself, that turned out to be wrong, of something someone did. maybe once. maybe multiple times. maybe all the time. of the way you saw life for everyone around you. that on top of the first two. who else just can't let go of someone. or something. or many people and many things.
noticing negative behaviours while talking to someone i quickly notice negative behaviours when i talk to people. i feel like their sound changes, they roll their eyes etc. so i stop talking to them immediately. and when i notice, it ruins my day. it is one of the things that makes me avoid most of the social interactions. can you guys relate?
i used to believe that embracing my true self would lead to inner peace, but now i'm not even sure who that self is. the chaotic whirlwind of emotions inside me feels like a storm threatening to uproot every ounce of stability. who am i, really? and if my emotions can be so fickle, how can i trust that they're a true reflection of my identity?
i can t trust myself these days. my emotions fluctuate like a mood ring in the hand of a toddler, changing unpredictably at a moment s notice. who am i when they dissipate, and who do i become when they resurface? these fragments feel like my very core, yet they evade me like shadows, slipping through my fingers when i reach out to grab them.
found an avpd plush ? i came across this company that makes plushies off of disorders and other disabilities and there was one for avpd. not sure how i feel, i guess since it's the first i see avpd incorporated anywhere lol. just wanted to see you guys' thoughts on this https www.instagram.com p cpcl9bvo w https www.instagram.com p cpcl9bvo w
afraid to talk or use your voice? it is difficult in real life, but i play a lot of video games and it is difficult there too. i don't know why i'm so nervous around people i will never know. relatable? also if you are interested, vr chat can be a good place to practice socializing relatively safely. lots of internet jerks there fair warning
think about how they might cope with these feelings. in the mirror, i see the shell of a person i once knew. my emotions flutter like a broken kite, unstable and unpredictable. who am i if not the sum of my feelings? yet, i muster the strength to reach for that kite's string, anchoring myself in the present moment, in hopes of steady ground.
i can't seem to find my place in the world, or even in myself. my emotions fluctuate wildly, leaving me unsure of who i truly am. sometimes i feel like a chameleon, blending in with the crowd but never truly belonging. other times, i feel like an island, isolated and alone. the uncertainty consumes me, making every interaction a challenge.
internal monologue who am i, really? one moment i feel like i've got this whole thing figured out, the next i'm a mess of confusion and self doubt. my emotions are like a rollercoaster, taking me on wild rides i can't control. i wish i could just find some stability, some sense of self, but it feels like i'm always chasing a moving target.
i think the best approach would be to give it a conversational tone, as though the speaker is in their head. who am i, really? this isn't who i want to be, but is it who i truly am? my emotions swing wildly from one extreme to another, leaving me unsure of where i fit in the world, and questioning whether i'm worthy of being there at all.
any older people with avpd there? how does it evolve with age? i honestly feel despair when thinking about the future because deep down i know it's not going to get better. but i'd like to hear experiences from actually older people older as 40 but even 30 may feel useful plus, anyone recovered? is it even truly possible to fully recover?
i was once a confident, proud, independent woman. now my emotions shift on the breeze. internal monologue i've lost myself in the mirrored maze of indecisiveness and contradictions. my once steadfast identity is adrift like a fragile leaf on an unpredictable river. how did i become a puppet, strung up by the whims of my unstable emotions?
inner turmoil gnawed at her very core, like a disease she couldn't quite isolate or cure. each day she awoke with a renewed hope for stability, but like a broken record, her emotions played out in unpredictable chaos. every reflection in the mirror unveiled a face she couldn't reconcile, and every echo of her voice rang with uncertainty.
what is avpd like? i had social anxiety or still have some of it. i also was diagnosed with avpd by one therapist but i am not sure if that one fits. i tick a few boxes and every personality style test says i am anxious avoidant but i don't really know what that would mean. so what it something that makes someone avpd in your experience?
as i peer into the looking glass, the familiar reflection fails to meet my gaze, replaced instead by a hollow shell of uncertainty and instability. my heart echoes the insecurity mirrored in my countenance, my mind a battleground where the past clashes with the future, and i am left a prisoner in the fortress of my own identity crisis.
as a guy, i wish i was raised by my father instead of my mother. i just had to get this off my chest. it's not that my father is perfect. and, while my mother has improved, throughout childhood, i was subject to feminization, neuroticism, and hysteria by my mother and 2 sisters. it is only now that i realize this. just venting, sorry.
i dream that someone would adopt me. i'm 23 years old. i hope everyday that someone else than my mom would see me, find something they like about me and decide to brush me off and give me a piece of shelter. i've been through too much shit to start over with my family and i just want to feel like i matter and i can make a difference.
internal monologue why can't i just be me? i try, i really do, but the person i am one day seems so different from the person i am the next. emotions swirling like an unstable hurricane inside of me, ripping apart the fragments of self i thought i had gathered. who am i, truly? is this just who i'll always be, an ever changing storm?
internal monologue i m torn between the image i want to present to the world, and the chaos that reigns in my soul. every smile hides the turmoil, every nod of agreement conceals the storm. the puzzle of me has more missing pieces than an unsolved riddle, and i'm weary of holding myself together with duct tape and wishful thinking.
their name doesn t matter. as i stare at my reflection in the mirror, the twisted maze of my thoughts reflects back at me, a tangled web of insecurity and self doubt that leaves me questioning who i truly am. am i the sum of my perceived flaws, or is there a kernel of authenticity hidden beneath the layers of my fractured identity?
internal monologue who am i, really? one moment i feel like i belong, the next i'm certain i don't. my emotions are a rollercoaster, leaving me disoriented and uncertain. i'm torn between wanting to be close to others and pushing them away, fearful of rejection but also craving connection. i wish i could just be stable, just be me.
as i stare into the mirror, a fractured reflection of who i once was stares back. my thoughts churn and twist like a storm within, and the emotions that once defined me have become volatile and unpredictable. the person i trust myself to be no longer feels solid the boundaries blurring until i m lost in the gray area of identity.
i long to be someone else, to shed this skin that feels too tight and uncomfortable, but who am i if not this person? the mirror reflects an unfamiliar face, one that doesn't match the identity i've tried to carve out for myself. my emotions are a storm inside me, unpredictable and destructive, leaving me feeling lost and alone.
internal monologue who am i, really? sometimes i feel like a chameleon, blending into whatever environment i'm in, only to discover i've lost myself in the process. and the emotions they're a rollercoaster, unpredictable and disorienting. one moment i'm elated, the next i'm crashing down, leaving me questioning if i'm even real.
have them question what is truly them, and what they ve only imagined or adopted due to external influences. interior monologue am i who i've always believed myself to be, or a complex mosaic of borrowed masks and fractured narratives? these feelings, these memories are they mine alone or a chameleon's palette of borrowed hues?
as i stand in front of the mirror, a maze of conflicting emotions swirls within me. i'm not sure which reflection is the real one the image of strength and resolve or the one concealing fragility and uncertainty. my identity seems as elusive as the mirage in the desert, and my emotions as tenuous as a thread barely hanging on.
cat is missing and i have no one i can talk to. our cat who i love dearly has been missing for 3 nights now and she s never stayed outside for more than a few hours in the entire last 2 years that we ve lived here so i m really worried. it sucks having no friends sometimes. i wish i had a single good friend i could talk to.
keep in mind, these are likely to be the inner musings of a teenager or young adult, so be mindful of diction and pacing. in the labyrinthine maze of my fragmented thoughts, a voice echoes, who am i, if not the reflection of their expectations? but this question, familiar yet elusive, lingers, refusing to reveal the answer.
resentment ever hate people because you can't ever be like them? i have this person in my class and she's so perfect, so put together, she makes me jealous. if i'm ever good at something she'll be better.... its like i can never be better than her in anything. i know i sound immature, dumb too but i needed to let this out.
i wish i could find a sense of belonging somewhere, anywhere, but instead my emotions flicker like a faulty neon sign, never quite settling long enough to illuminate a clear path forward. i'm a chameleon hiding in plain sight, constantly adapting to fit the molds of others, always feeling a little bit wrong in my own skin.
remember that the thought can be ambiguous, as internal thoughts tend to be. as i gaze into the mirror, the reflection blurring with every blink, the line between self and illusion grows ever thinner. who am i when my emotions swing wildly like a pendulum, always on the precipice of shattering this fragile sense of self?
my reflection stares back at me, a stranger i've known for too long, but today i don't even recognize. i'm a chameleon, constantly adapting to fit in, yet always feeling out of place. emotions flicker within me like unpredictable flames, leaving me longing for stability, but fearing the loss of the chaos that defines me.
how would i go about telling a person with avpd how much i admire them? from what i understand of this disorder, it would be difficult near impossible to actually make them believe it. is there any way i could? is it worth trying regardless of the end result? would it make them uncomfortable? thank you for any responses
my reflection mocks me back, its cold, empty eyes revealing a stranger i've grown to despise. this shell i inhabit feels borrowed, like a costumed performance where i've forgotten the true script, the heartbeat of who i am. can i reclaim my identity, or am i doomed to drown in this abyss of inconsistency and self doubt?
being vulnerable sucks i opened up to coworkers about being bisexual, and it feels awful feeling so vulnerable and exposed. it feels really bad giving people ammo to judge you. but i took a big risk opening up to them, in hopes it brings us closer. we'll see how it pays off, but right now it feels super uncomfortable.
my reflection stares back at me, an unfamiliar face in a familiar shell. i wonder who i am when i'm not wearing this mask, this collection of labels and expectations. but every time i try to peel it off, i'm met with a mirror of confusion and instability, leaving me longing for the safety of the roles i once embraced.

anyone scarred by 1 period in their life? for me, it was high school. just forgetting it and realizing that i will not carry those people along with me for the rest of my life has been such a boon. those were just a random assemblage of people thrown at me. nothing less, nothing more. they don't matter to me anymore.
remember, we re trying to convey a deep, personal struggle, even if it's only through a brief quote. in the mirror of my soul, a storm rages on, shifting currents of self image, flickering like the electric lantern of an old lighthouse, desperate to anchor my fragmented identity amidst the chaotic waves of emotions.
podcasts for avoidant people? i'm trying to find podcasts for people who are late 20s or 30s and haven't really had much experience work, career, dating, etc. i keep trying podcasts and not relating because these people are confident and have done so much in their 20s and even their teens and are really confident...

can't get over anything so the memories just build up everything something bad happens, or i embarrass myself, or make someone mad, etc. i'm not able to get over it, so there are just more and more memories that give me cringe attacks. if anyone has any tips on how to deal with these cringe attacks, do let me know
